# THE HTML VERSION OF THE NOTES IS CURRENTLY BROKEN, TO VIEW THEM EITHER USE OBSIDIAN OR GO BACK A FEW COMMITS
## In the last commits there still is a html folder, but all the formulas in latex are broken. So go back further.

If you want to read these notes, you either have to:
- Download the repo and open the html versions with the explorer(it will use chrome or edge to open them).
- Install Obsidian, download this repo and open it.
