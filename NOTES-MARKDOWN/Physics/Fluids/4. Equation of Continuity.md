> [!warning] [Ideal Fluid](1.%20Hydrostatics%20&%20Ideal%20Fluid.md) Model
> To simplify the study of fluid dynamics, the concept of an **ideal fluid** is often used. An ideal fluid possesses the following properties:
> 
> • **Incompressible**: Its **density ($\rho$) remains constant** during flow.
> • **Zero Viscosity**: There is **no [friction](Friction.md) between adjacent layers of the fluid**.
> • **Stationary Law**: The **velocity of each element of the fluid does not vary with time**.
> • **Irrotational**: Its **angular momentum is zero at each point**.

### Equation of Continuity

The Equation of Continuity describes the **flow of a fluid through a pipe with different sized sections at the same height**.

The equation of continuity states that the **amount of liquid that flows inside the two sections is the same**.

> [!hint]
> This equation means that the **product of the cross-sectional area and the fluid's velocity remains constant** along a streamline. 
> Therefore, if the **area increases, the velocity of the fluid must decrease**, and vice-versa. 
> "The larger the area, the slower is the fluid".

> [!note] How to get the formula
> If a fluid flows through two sections of a pipe (Section 1 and Section 2), the continuity equation can be derived from the concept that the mass flow rate remains constant.
> 1. The amount of liquid flowing can be expressed in terms of volume ($\Delta V$) and density ($\rho$), so $\Delta V_1 \rho = \Delta V_2 \rho$.
> 2. Since density is constant for an [ideal fluid](1.%20Hydrostatics%20&%20Ideal%20Fluid.md), this simplifies to $\Delta V_1 = \Delta V_2$.
> 3. The volume of fluid passing through a section is its cross-sectional area ($A$) multiplied by the distance the fluid travels ($\Delta x$), so $A_1 \Delta x_1 = A_2 \Delta x_2$.
> 4. As $\Delta x = v \Delta t$ (velocity multiplied by time), we get $A_1 v_1 \Delta t = A_2 v_2 \Delta t$.
> 5. Finally, dividing by $\Delta t$, the **Equation of Continuity** is derived as: 
> $$\Large \mathbf{A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2}$$

> [!example]
> This concept is used in problems to determine flow rates. For instance, in an exercise involving water entering a submarine through a hole, "portata" (flow rate) is mentioned as $v_2 A$, which is directly related to this equation.
