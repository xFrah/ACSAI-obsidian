It describes the relationship between pressure, depth, and density in a fluid at rest.

If you submerge an object in a liquid, the forces acting along the vertical (y) axis include:
- the gravitational force
- the pressure from the water and atmosphere above it
- the compensating pressure from the water below the object.

This leads to the formulation of Pascal's Law, which states that the **pressure ($P$) at a certain depth ($h$)** within a fluid is given by: $$\Large P = P_0 + \rho g h$$
Where:
- **$P_0$** is the **pressure at the surface** of the fluid (e.g., atmospheric pressure).
- **$\rho$** is the **density of the fluid**.
- **$g$** is the **acceleration due to gravity**.
- **$h$** is the **depth** from the surface to the point where pressure is being measured.

> [!hint]
> A key implication of Pascal's Law is that the **pressure in a fluid at a given depth does not depend on the shape of the object** submerged in it.

> This law is also related to [Bernoulli's formula](5.%20Bernoulli's%20Formula.md); specifically, if the velocity of the fluid is zero ($v=0$), Bernoulli's formula simplifies to Pascal's law.
