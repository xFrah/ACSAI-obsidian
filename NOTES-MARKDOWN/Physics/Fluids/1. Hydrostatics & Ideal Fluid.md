**Fluid mechanics** is the study of how fluids (liquids and gases) behave.

> [!quote] Definition of a fluid
> A **fluid** is defined as a substance that **does not have a fixed shape** but instead **assumes the container's shape**. 


## Hydrostatics

**Hydrostatics** specifically deals with fluids at rest.

> [!warning] Ideal Fluid Model
> To simplify the study of fluid dynamics, the concept of an **ideal fluid** is often used. An ideal fluid possesses the following properties:
> 
> • **Incompressible**: Its **density ($\rho$) remains constant** during flow.
> • **Zero Viscosity**: There is **no [friction](../Mechanics/5.%20Friction.md) between adjacent layers of the fluid**.
> • **Stationary Law**: The **velocity of each element of the fluid does not vary with time**.
> • **Irrotational**: Its **angular momentum is zero at each point**.


### Pressure in Fluids

A fluid can **exert a pressure on an object** that is submerged in it.
This pressure will always be **perpendicular to the object's surface** and **equal in all its points**.

The above fact is why pressure is defined as the **force ($F$) per unit area ($A$)**: 

$$\Large P \equiv \frac{F}{A}$$

Pressure is measured in **pascals (Pa)**, equivalent to $\large \frac{N}{m^2}$.
