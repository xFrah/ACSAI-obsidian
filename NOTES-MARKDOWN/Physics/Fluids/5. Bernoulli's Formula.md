Bernoulli's formula is a powerful equation derived from the **study of kinetic and potential energy** within a fluid. 
It describes the relationship between pressure, fluid speed, and height in a moving fluid.

For an [ideal fluid](1.%20Hydrostatics%20&%20Ideal%20Fluid.md) flowing along a streamline, **the sum of**:
- its **pressure** energy,
- its **kinetic energy** per unit volume,
- its **potential energy** per unit volume...
... **remains constant**.
$$\Large P + \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 + \rho g \Delta y = \text{constant}$$
Where:
- **P** represents the **pressure** of the fluid.
- **$\frac{1}{2} \rho v^2$** represents the **kinetic energy per unit volume** of the fluid, where $\rho$ is the fluid's density and $v$ is its speed.
- **$\rho g \Delta y$** represents the **potential energy per unit volume** of the fluid, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $\Delta y$ (or $h$ in other contexts) is the height.

> [!hint]
> The formula implies that if one term (pressure, kinetic energy, or potential energy) increases, at least one of the other terms must decrease to maintain the constant sum. 
> Specifically, the notes state: "So, if the velocity or the height increases, the pressure has to decrease".

> [!note] **Relationship to [Pascal's Law](2.%20Pascal's%20law.md)**
> A significant insight is that **if the velocity of the fluid is zero ($v=0$), Bernoulli's formula simplifies to [Pascal's Law](2.%20Pascal's%20law.md)** ($P = P_0 + \rho g h$) [my previous response, 145]. This highlights that Pascal's Law is a specific case of Bernoulli's formula for fluids at rest.

> [!example]
> Bernoulli's Law is applied in various scenarios, such as calculating the speed of water entering a submarine through a hole. In such a problem, it's applied between the surface of the sea and the hole. 
> When the velocity at the surface ($v_1$) is much smaller than the velocity at the hole ($v_2$), it can be approximated as $v_1=0$. This approximation, combined with the assumption of constant atmospheric pressure ($P_0$), leads to **Torricelli's Law**: $\frac{1}{2} \rho v_2^2 = \rho g X$, or $v_2 = \sqrt{2gX}$, where X is the depth of the hole from the surface.
