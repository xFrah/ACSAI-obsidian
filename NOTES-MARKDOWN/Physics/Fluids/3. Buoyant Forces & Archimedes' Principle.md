When an object is placed in a liquid, the liquid exerts an **upward force** on the object, known as the **buoyant force**.

The buoyant force arises from the pressure difference between the bottom and top of the submerged object.

**Archimedes' Principle** quantifies this force: 

$$\Large B = \rho_{\text{\small fluid}} g V$$
Where:
- **$\rho_{fluid}$** is the **density of the fluid**.
- **$g$** is the **acceleration due to gravity**.
- **$V$** is the **volume of the fluid displaced by the object** (which is equal to the volume of the submerged part of the object).

> [!hint]
> The buoyant force **depends only on the fluid's density and the volume of the object (or its submerged part)**, not the object's mass directly.
> 
> The effect of the buoyant force depends on the object's weight:
> - If the **weight of the object is greater than $B$**, the object will **sink**.
> - If the **weight equals $B$**, the object will be **still (suspended)**.
> - If the **weight is less than $B$**, the object will **float** on the water.

> - calculating the speed of water entering a submarine through a hole
> - analyzing a cubic object floating or suspended in water
> - studying the flow in a syringe.
