> [!quote] Definition of Force
> A force is a vectorial **quantity that gives acceleration to a body**. It is measured in Newtons (N).
> 1 Newton is equal to pushing 1kg on an horizontal plane without friction with an acceleration of $1 \frac{m}{s}$.
> $$N= Kg\cdot \frac{m}{s^2}$$

## First law

In the **absence of an external force** every object remains **at rest or in uniform motion.**

## Second law

The acceleration of the object depends on the **force and mass** of the object.

$$\LARGE \vec{F} = m\cdot\vec{a}$$

## Third law

Whenever an objects exerts a force on another object, **the second object exerts an equal and opposite force** on the first one.

$$\Large \vec{F}_{\Delta2}=-\vec{F}_{21}$$
