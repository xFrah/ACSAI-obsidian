What would you do if you wanted to calculate the flux of a force going through a perpendicular area?
You take a single force vector, and you multiply by the area.

$$\Large \phi=\vec{E}\cdot A$$![[Pasted image 20260108165819.png]]

But what if this area was angled instead? The more the surface is angled, the fewer vectors pass through it:

$$\Large \phi=\vec{E}\cdot A\cos\theta=\vec{E}\cdot \vec{A}$$![[angledflux.png]]

Perfect. But what if we want to describe complex surfaces?

## Gauss Theorem

Flux through a 3D sphere?
$$\Large \phi = \oint\vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A}$$

where:
- $\oint$ means integration over a closed surface (in this case a sphere)
- $\vec{E}$ is the electric field that goes through the tiny pieces of areas
- $d\vec{A}$ is the infinitesimally small area vectors that will by multiplied by $\vec{E}$ and then summed by the integral.

### Simpler formula for sphere

We can simplify that dot product, since in the case of a charge enclosed by a sphere, the area vectors and the electric field vectors point in the same direction (picture above).

So we can just substitute it with a scalar product:

$$\Large \phi = \oint E \; dA$$

We also know that in a sphere the radius is the same everywhere, so $E$ is constant, and we can bring it out of the integral

$$\Large \phi = E \oint \; dA$$

and $\oint dA$ is just $A$:

$$\Large \phi = EA$$
