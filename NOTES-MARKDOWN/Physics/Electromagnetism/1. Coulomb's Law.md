Describes the **electric force** that exists between two charged particles.
The **magnitude** of this electric force is determined by **Coulomb's Law**:

$$\Large F_e = k_e \frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2} \text{}$$

Let's break down the components of this formula:

- $\large \boldsymbol{q_1}$ and $\large \boldsymbol{q_2}$: **Magnitudes of the electric charges** of the two particles.
- $\large \boldsymbol{r}$: This is the **distance** separating the two charges.
- $\large \boldsymbol{k_e}$: This is known as the **Coulomb constant**. Its approximate numerical value is $\large 8.9876 \cdot 10^9 N \frac{m^2}{C^2}$.

> [!note] 
> Coulomb Constant and Permittivity of Free Space The **Coulomb constant ($\large \boldsymbol{k_e}$)** can also be expressed in terms of another fundamental constant, the **permittivity of free space ($\large \boldsymbol{\epsilon_0}$)**:
> 
> $$\Large k_e = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \text{}$$
> 
> The value of $\large \epsilon_0$ is approximately $\large 8.8542 \cdot 10^{-12} \frac{C^2}{N \cdot m^2}$.
> 
> As a common reference, the charge of a single electron is approximately $\large -1.602 \cdot 10^{-19} C$.

> [!hint] 
> The **electric force** differs from gravitational force in that it can be either **attractive** or **repulsive** (opposite charges).
