It can be considered analogous to **potential energy in gravity**.
Electric potential is most often considered as a **difference ($\large \boldsymbol{\Delta V}$)** between two points in space, rather than an absolute value. 
This **electric potential difference** is defined in terms of the **change in electric potential energy ($\large \boldsymbol{\Delta U}$)** experienced by a test charge ($\large \boldsymbol{q_0}$) as it moves between those points, divided by the magnitude of that charge:

$$\Large \Delta V \equiv \frac{\Delta U}{q_0}$$

This means that electric potential is the **potential energy per unit charge**.

The electric potential difference ($\large \boldsymbol{\Delta V}$) between two points (say, A and B) can also be determined by the **[[2. Electric field|electric field]] ($\large \boldsymbol{\vec{E}}$)** present in the region. It is calculated as the negative of the [[7. Definite Integrals|integral]] of the electric field along the path from the initial point (A) to the final point (B):

$$\Large \Delta V = V_B - V_A = -\int_{A}^{B} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{s}$$

> [!hint]
> This relationship implies that the **electric field ($\large \boldsymbol{\vec{E}}$)** can be interpreted as the **rapidity of the change of potential with distance**. Therefore, the electric field points in the direction of decreasing potential, meaning electric field lines typically go **from regions of higher (positive) potential to regions of lower (negative) potential**.

> [!note] Units of Electric Potential
> The standard unit for electric potential is the **volt (V)**. By definition, **1 Volt (V) represents 1 Joule (J) of [[Work & Energy|work]] per 1 Coulomb (C) of charge**.


### Potential from a Point Charge 

For a simple case, such as a **point charge (Q)**, the electric potential (V) at a distance (r) from the charge is given by the formula: **V = kQ/r**, where 'k' is Coulomb's constant.
