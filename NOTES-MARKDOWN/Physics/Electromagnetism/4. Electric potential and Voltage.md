## Electric potential

Same concept of potential energy as mechanics.
The electric potential accumulates the force put upon charges across some distance, and it equals to negative work:

$$\Large U=-\int\vec{F}\cdot d\vec{s}$$
$$\Large \Delta U = -W$$

> [!hint]
> Imagine dragging a charge in the opposite direction of the electric force. For each little step it accumulates potential energy.


## Voltage

Accumulation of electric field across distance.
Same formula as the electric potential, but the force is put upon a charge of mass +1.

$$\Large \Delta V=-\int\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{s}=\frac{\Delta U}{q}$$
