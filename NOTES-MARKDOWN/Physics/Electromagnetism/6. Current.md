Flow rate of charges. Basically how many charges move past a point per second. It is measured in $\text{amperes}=\frac{\text{coulombs}}{\text{second}}$:

$$\Large i=\frac{dq}{dt}$$

This means "derivative of the charge with respect to time". 
Assuming we have a function of the charge with respect to time $q(t)$, we derive it to get its rate of change.

> [!hint]
> **q(t)** tells you **"how much charge has accumulated (or passed)"** at a specific moment in time tt.

> [!hint] Current direction
> The direction of current is that of the flow of positive charge.


## Current density

Measures how much current per unit of area is passing through a certain point.
