## Electric force as a [[4. Conservative and Non-Conservative forces#Conservative forces|Conservative force]]

The **electric force** is a **conservative force**. This means that the work done by a conservative force on a particle moving through an arbitrary **closed path is zero**.

> [!hint]
> For any conservative force, a **potential energy function ($\large \boldsymbol{U}$)** can be associated with it. The **change in the potential energy ($\large \boldsymbol{\Delta U}$)** of a system equals the **negative of the work done by that conservative force**.

> This relationship is expressed as: 
> $$\Large \Delta U = -W_{conservative}$$


The work done _by the electric force_ ($\large \boldsymbol{W_e}$) is equal to the **negative of the change in electric potential energy**:

$$\Large W_e = -\Delta U$$

Since the change in potential energy ($\large \boldsymbol{\Delta U}$) for a charge ($\large \boldsymbol{q_0}$) moving along a path ($\large \boldsymbol{ds}$) in an electric field ($\large \boldsymbol{\vec{E}}$) is given by:

$$\Large \Delta U = -q_0 \int_{A}^{B} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{s}$$

The work done by the electric force ($\large \boldsymbol{W_e}$) as a charge moves from point A to point B can be expressed as: 
$$\Large W_e = q_0 \int_{A}^{B} \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{s}$$

> [!hint] Relationship to [[3. Electric potential|electric potential]]
> The **electric potential difference ($\large \boldsymbol{\Delta V}$)** between two points is defined as the **change in electric potential energy per unit charge** ($\large \boldsymbol{\Delta V \equiv \frac{\Delta U}{q_0}}$). 
> This also means that $\large \boldsymbol{\Delta U = q_0 \Delta V}$. Combining this with the work-energy relationship for conservative forces, the work done by the electric force can also be related to the electric potential difference: $\large \boldsymbol{W_e = - \Delta U = -q_0 \Delta V}$ If a charge $\large \boldsymbol{q_0}$ moves from point A to point B, then $\large \boldsymbol{\Delta V = V_B - V_A}$. So, the work done by the electric force is $\large \boldsymbol{W_e = -q_0 (V_B - V_A) = q_0 (V_A - V_B)}$. The electric force on a charge $\large \boldsymbol{q}$ in an [[2. Electric field|electric field]] $\large \boldsymbol{\vec{E}}$ is given by $\large \boldsymbol{\vec{F}_e = q\vec{E}}$. This implies that if a positive charge moves from a higher potential to a lower potential (i.e., in the direction of the electric field), the electric force does positive work. Conversely, if it moves against the electric field, the electric force does negative work. For an electron (a negative charge), moving in the direction of the electric field would mean its potential energy increases, and the electric field does negative work.
