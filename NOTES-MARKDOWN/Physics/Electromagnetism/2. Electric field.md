The **Electric Field ($\large \boldsymbol{\vec{E}}$)** at a point in space is defined as the **electric force ($\large \boldsymbol{\vec{F}_e}$)** experienced by a positive test charge ($\large \boldsymbol{q_0}$) placed at that point, divided by the magnitude of the test charge:

$$\Large \vec{E} \equiv \frac{\vec{F}_e}{q_0}$$

> [!hint]
> This definition also implies that if an electric field ($\large \boldsymbol{\vec{E}}$) exists at a point, a charge ($\large \boldsymbol{q}$) placed at that point will experience an electric force ($\large \boldsymbol{\vec{F}_e}$) given by:

### Direction of the electric field

The direction of the electric field ($\large \boldsymbol{\vec{E}}$) is defined by how a positive test charge would behave within it.

- If the source charge creating the field is **positive**, the electric field lines will **diverge from the source** (point outwards).
- If the source charge is **negative**, the electric field lines will **converge towards the source** (point inwards).

## Electric Field from multiple charges

The electric field created by a collection of point charges can be found by summing the contributions from each individual charge ([[1. Coulomb's Law|Coulomb's Law]]). 
For multiple charges ($\large \boldsymbol{q_i}$), the electric field at a point is given by:

$$\Large \vec{E} = k_e \sum_i \frac{q_i}{r_i^2} \hat{r_i}$$
Where:

- $\large \boldsymbol{k_e}$: is the Coulomb constant, approximately $\large 8.9876 \cdot 10^9 N \cdot \frac{m^2}{C^2}$.
- $\large \boldsymbol{q_i}$: is the magnitude of the $\large i^{th}$ source charge.
- $\large \boldsymbol{r_i}$: is the distance from the $\large i^{th}$ source charge to the point where the field is being calculated.
- $\large \boldsymbol{\hat{r_i}}$: is a unit vector pointing from the $\large i^{th}$ source charge towards the point of interest.

## Motion of a Charged Particle in a Uniform Electric Field

When a charged particle is placed in a **uniform electric field**, it experiences a constant electric force, resulting in constant acceleration.

Consider a particle of charge $q$ and mass $m$ placed at rest at point A in a uniform electric field $\vec{E}$ (_example above_). 
The force exerted on the particle by the electric field is:

$$\Large \vec{F}=m\vec{a}=q\vec{E}$$

> [!hint]  
> The final velocity of the particle can be found using either **kinematics** or **conservation of energy**.
> 
> **Using Kinematics (Equations of Motion):**  
> From [[2. Newton's laws|Newton's second law]], the acceleration $\vec{a}$ is constant:
> 
> $$\Large \vec{a}=\frac{\vec{F}}{m}=-\frac{q\vec{E}}{m}$$
> 
> Using the [[1. Kinematics|kinematic]] equation $v_{f2}=v_{i2}+2ad$ with $v_i=0$, the final velocity $v_B$ after traveling a distance $d$ is:
> 
> $$\Large v_B=\sqrt{2ad}=\sqrt{\frac{2dqE}{m}}$$
> 
> **Using Conservation of Energy:**  
> For an isolated system, the change in total energy is zero. As the particle moves, its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy:
> 
> $$\Large ΔK+ΔU=0$$

## Electric Dipole in a Uniform Electric Field

An **electric dipole** consists of two equal and opposite charges separated by a distance. 

![[Pasted image 20250804130934.png]]


The **electric dipole moment** $\vec{p}$ is a vector quantity defined as:

$$\Large \vec{p}≡q\vec{d}$$

where $\vec{d}$ is the displacement vector from the negative to the positive charge.

When placed in an external electric field $\vec{E}$, a dipole experiences a **torque** that tends to align it with the field:

$$\Large\vec{τ}=\vec{p}×\vec{E}$$

The system also has a **potential energy** $U$ which depends on the orientation of the dipole relative to the field:

$$\Large U=−\vec{p}⋅\vec{E}=−pEcos⁡θ$$

> [!note]  
> The potential energy has key values based on the angle θθ between p⃗p and E⃗E:
> 
> - **U = -pE** (minimum energy): When p⃗p is parallel to E⃗E (θ=0∘θ=0∘). This is a stable equilibrium.
>     
> - **U = 0**: When p⃗p is perpendicular to E⃗E (θ=90∘θ=90∘).
>     
> - **U = +pE** (maximum energy): When p⃗p is anti-parallel to E⃗E (θ=180∘θ=180∘). This is an unstable equilibrium.

## Electric Flux

**Electric flux** (ΦEΦE) is a measure of the electric field passing through a given surface. For a surface SS, it is defined by the surface [[7. Definite Integrals|integral]]:

ΦE≡∫SE⃗⋅dA⃗ΦE≡∫SE⋅dA

where dA⃗dA is a vector representing an infinitesimal element of area, with its direction perpendicular to the surface. For a **closed surface**, the integral is written as ∮∮.

> [!hint]  
> If the electric field E⃗E is perpendicular to the surface normal vector A⃗A at all points on the surface, the [[dot product]] is zero, and thus the **electric flux is zero**.

> [!example] Flux through a Cube in a Uniform Field  
> Consider a cube placed in a uniform electric field E⃗E that is parallel to the x-axis. The **total flux through the closed surface of the cube is zero**.
> 
> - **Faces perpendicular to E⃗E:** The left face has dA⃗dA anti-parallel to E⃗E (θ=180∘θ=180∘), so Φleft=−EAΦleft=−EA. The right face has dA⃗dA parallel to E⃗E (θ=0∘θ=0∘), so Φright=+EAΦright=+EA. The sum is zero.
>     
> - **Faces parallel to E⃗E:** For the four other faces, the area vector dA⃗dA is perpendicular to E⃗E (θ=90∘θ=90∘), so the flux through each is zero.
>     
> 
> Therefore, the total flux through the cube is:
> 
> Φtotal=∮E⃗⋅dA⃗=−EA+EA+0+0+0+0=0Φtotal=∮E⋅dA=−EA+EA+0+0+0+0=0
