Describes the **influence a charged particle exerts** on the space around it.

> [!note] Test Charge
The **electric field** is defined using a "test charge" ($\large \boldsymbol{q_0}$). The test charge's purpose is to detect and measure the presence and characteristics of the electric field.


The **Electric Field ($\large \boldsymbol{\vec{E}}$)** at a point in space is defined as the **electric force ($\large \boldsymbol{\vec{F}_e}$)** experienced by a positive test charge ($\large \boldsymbol{q_0}$) placed at that point, divided by the magnitude of the test charge:

$$\Large \vec{E} \equiv \frac{\vec{F}_e}{q_0}$$

> [!hint]
> This definition also implies that if an electric field ($\large \boldsymbol{\vec{E}}$) exists at a point, a charge ($\large \boldsymbol{q}$) placed at that point will experience an electric force ($\large \boldsymbol{\vec{F}_e}$) given by:

> $$\Large \vec{F}_e = q\vec{E}$$

### Direction of the electric field

The direction of the electric field ($\large \boldsymbol{\vec{E}}$) is defined by how a positive test charge would behave within it.

- If the source charge creating the field is **positive**, the electric field lines will **diverge from the source** (point outwards).
- If the source charge is **negative**, the electric field lines will **converge towards the source** (point inwards).

## Electric Field from multiple charges

The electric field created by a collection of point charges can be found by summing the contributions from each individual charge ([[1. Coulomb's Law|Coulomb's Law]]). 
For multiple charges ($\large \boldsymbol{q_i}$), the electric field at a point is given by:

$$\Large \vec{E} = k_e \sum_i \frac{q_i}{r_i^2} \hat{r_i}$$
Where:

- $\large \boldsymbol{k_e}$: is the Coulomb constant, approximately $\large 8.9876 \cdot 10^9 N \cdot \frac{m^2}{C^2}$.
- $\large \boldsymbol{q_i}$: is the magnitude of the $\large i^{th}$ source charge.
- $\large \boldsymbol{r_i}$: is the distance from the $\large i^{th}$ source charge to the point where the field is being calculated.
- $\large \boldsymbol{\hat{r_i}}$: is a unit vector pointing from the $\large i^{th}$ source charge towards the point of interest.
