Circular motion describes the movement of a particle along a circular path.

## Uniform Circular Motion

When the particle moves with **constant speed**.

### Radius

The distance from the center of the circle to the particle.

### Angular Velocity

Measured in radians per second (rad/s), it describes how fast the angle changes. $$\Large \omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}$$ Where $T$ is the period.

> [!hint]
> The formula is basically saying: How fast are we going? How many radians per unit of time are we going? So you just **divide the space you covered by the time it took** to get there.


### Period

The time it takes for the particle to complete one full oscillation or revolution. $$\Large T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = \frac{2\pi r}{v}$$
### Speed

The magnitude of the instantaneous velocity, which is constant in uniform circular motion. $$\Large v = r\omega$$
### Position Vector

If the origin is set at the center of the circle, the position vector of a particle at time $t$ can be expressed as: $$\Large \vec{r} = r \cos(\omega t) \hat{i} + r \sin(\omega t) \hat{j}$$
### Velocity Vector

The instantaneous velocity vector is found by deriving the position vector with respect to time: $$\Large \vec{v} = -r\omega \sin(\omega t) \hat{i} + r\omega \cos(\omega t) \hat{j}$$The velocity vector $\vec{v}$ is always **perpendicular** to the position vector $\vec{r}$ ($\vec{r} \cdot \vec{v} = 0$), which is why the velocity is referred to as **tangential velocity**.

### Acceleration Vector

The acceleration vector is found by deriving the velocity vector with respect to time: $$\Large \vec{a} = -r\omega^2 \cos(\omega t) \hat{i} - r\omega^2 \sin(\omega t) \hat{j}$$This can also be written as $\vec{a} = -\omega^2 \vec{r}$, showing that the acceleration vector is always directed **opposite** to the position vector, pointing towards the center of the circle.

### Centripetal Acceleration

The magnitude of this acceleration is called **centripetal acceleration**, and its direction is always toward the center of the circle. $$\Large a = r\omega^2 = \frac{v^2}{r}$$

> In uniform circular motion, the tangential acceleration ($a_t$) is zero.

## General Circular Motion and Rotation

When an object rotates about an axis, it's not always undergoing uniform circular motion. Different parts of an extended object can have different linear velocities and accelerations.

### Angular Kinematics

For rotational motion, similar kinematic equations to linear motion apply: $$\Large \omega_t = \omega_0 + \alpha t$$ $$\Large \theta_t = \theta_0 + \omega_0 t + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2$$Where $\theta$ is the angular position, $\omega$ is the angular velocity, and $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration. The relation $\omega^2 = \omega_0^2 + 2\alpha(\theta - \theta_0)$ also applies.

### Tangential Acceleration

If the speed of the particle in circular motion is not constant, there is also a tangential acceleration. $$\Large a_t = r\alpha$$
The **total acceleration** ($\vec{a}$) in non-uniform circular motion is the vector sum of the tangential component ($\vec{a}_t$) and the centripetal component ($\vec{a}_c$): $$\Large \vec{a} = \vec{a}_t + \vec{a}_c$$
> [!hint]
> The centripetal acceleration always points towards the center of the circle, changing the direction of the velocity, while the tangential acceleration acts along the direction of motion, changing the magnitude of the velocity. In uniform circular motion, only the direction of velocity changes due to centripetal acceleration, as the speed is constant.
