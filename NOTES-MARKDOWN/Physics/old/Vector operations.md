### Vector * constant
$$\large c * \vec{V} = (c * v_x, c * v_y, c * v_z)$$

### Sum of vectors

$$\large \vec{V} + \vec{P} = (v_x + p_x, v_y + p_y, v_z + p_z)$$

### Dot/Scalar product

The dot product of two vectors A and B can be defined both algebraically and geometrically.

**Algebraically**, if $A=(a_1​,a_2​,…,a_n​)$ and $B=(b_1​,b_2​,…,b_n​)$, the dot product is given by:

$$\large \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \cdots + a_nb_n$$

**Geometrically**, the dot product can be expressed as:

$$\large \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = \|\mathbf{A}\| \|\mathbf{B}\| \cos(\theta)$$

where $∥A∥$ and $∥B∥$ are the magnitudes (or lengths) of vectors A and B respectively, and $\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors.

When the vectors are perpendicular $(θ=90\degree)$, the dot product is zero because $cos(90\degree)=0$. 
When the vectors are similar, the dot product is great.
When they go in opposite directions, the dot product is negative.

### Unitarian vector

$$\large U_a = \frac{a}{|\vec{a}|}$$

This gets the unit vector in the direction of a.
$|\vec{a}|$ is the magnitude of the vector.


> [!tldr] What?
> We are dividing a vector by its length to obtain a unit vector of length 1.

### Cross product???????
