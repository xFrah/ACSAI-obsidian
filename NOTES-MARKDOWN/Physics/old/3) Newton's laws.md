> [!quote] Definition of Force
A force is a vectorial quantity that gives acceleration to a body.

## First law

In the **absence of an external force** every object remains **at rest or in uniform motion.**

## Second law

The acceleration of the object depends on the **force and mass** of the object.

$$\LARGE \vec{F} = m\vec{a}$$

## Third law

Whenever an objects exerts a force on another object, **the second object exerts an equal and opposite force** on the first one.
