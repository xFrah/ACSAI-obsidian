Force that acts when an object is being dragged across a surface.
It acts in the opposite direction of the dragging.

The formula is:

$$\Large |F_f|=\mu\cdot |N|=\mu \cdot m\cdot g$$

Where $\mu$ is a constant that depends on the material, it can either be:
- $\mu_s$ (**static** friction coefficient): For when the object is starting to move from rest.
- $\mu_d$ (**dynamic** friction coefficient): For when the object is already moving.
