> The fact that this is a cycle of reversible thermodynamic processes means that we can go back to the starting state with no change in [entropy](5.%20Entropy.md) since nothing is dissipated.
> **Total entropy change of the universe (system + surroundings) is zero**. 
> **No energy is "dissipated"** in ways that would increase the overall disorder of the universe (e.g., [friction](Friction.md), heat transfer across a finite temperature difference).
