In thermodynamics, a **phase change** refers to the process where a substance transforms from one physical state to another, such as from solid to liquid, or liquid to gas1.

The key characteristic of a phase change during a transfer of heat is that **the temperature of the substance does not change linearly; instead, it stops for a moment**1. This occurs because the energy being added (or removed) is entirely used to facilitate the change in the substance's phase, rather than to increase (or decrease) its kinetic energy, which would manifest as a temperature change1.

This energy involved in changing the phase of a substance is known as **latent heat**1.

• The sources define **latent heat (L)** as the amount of heat ($Q$) required per unit mass (Δm) to change the phase of a substance1.

• The formula for latent heat is given as: $L = Q / \Delta m$1.

• This means that the heat transferred ($Q$) during a phase change can be calculated as $Q = L \cdot \Delta m$1.

• For example, in the context of calculations, latent heat is explicitly used for processes like vaporization23, where $Q = mL$3 or condensation, where $Q = -mL$2. This implies distinct latent heats for different phase transitions (e.g., latent heat of fusion for melting/freezing, latent heat of vaporization for boiling/condensing).

• **Only after all the particles of the body have changed phase, the temperature will rise again**1.

The sources provide examples and problems that directly involve phase changes:

• The mixing of ice and water, and the subsequent heating of the "cocktail" to a final temperature, implicitly involves the **melting of ice**, a phase transition at 0°C45.

• A question specifically asks about the **spontaneous transformation of water into ice** and the associated **variation of entropy**67. This highlights that phase changes are subject to the principles of thermodynamics, including entropy. As discussed, for a process like water spontaneously turning into ice at a higher temperature, the total entropy of the universe would need to increase, aligning with the Second Principle of Thermodynamics.
