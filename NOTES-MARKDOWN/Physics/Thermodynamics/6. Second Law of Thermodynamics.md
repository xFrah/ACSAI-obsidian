For any spontaneous process (or irreversible ones) in an isolated system, the total [entropy](5.%20Entropy.md) of the system **always increases or remains constant**. 

It directly states that it is impossible to construct a heat engine that achieves 100% efficiency because doing so would violate this principle, specifically by implying an unrealistic or negative change in entropy.

> A Carnot machine (an ideal machine) with 100% efficiency is impossible.

> [!hint]
> Since all natural processes are irreversible, this means that they lead to an **increase in the total entropy of the universe (system + surroundings)**.
