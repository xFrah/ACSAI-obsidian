**Thermodynamic processes** describe how the state of a gas changes with respect to its macroscopic properties such as **pressure**, **volume**, and **[[0. Internal energy - Temperature|temperature]]**.

The **[First Law of Thermodynamics](2.%20First%20Law%20of%20Thermodynamics.md)** always applies: 
$$\Large ΔU = Q − W$$
This is pure energy conservation. However, **different processes impose different constraints** on the system, and these constraints fundamentally alter how heat and work must be expressed mathematically.

## Isochoric Process (Isovolumetric)

This happens when the **volume can't change**, and so **no work is done** (by or on the system).
This means that all heat exchange translates directly to internal energy change.

$$\Large \Delta E_{int} = Q + 0$$
### Heat ($Q$)

The heat exchanged is equal to the internal energy, which for an ideal gas is:

$$\Large Q =\Delta E= nC_V\Delta T$$

where $C_V$ is the molar specific heat at constant volume.

## Isobaric Process

Occurs when the gas is **free to expand** and contract against the system boundaries.
This allows the gas to maintain **constant pressure**. Work can be done and heat can be exchanged.

### Heat ($Q$)

The heat exchanged is given by:

$$\Large Q = nC_P\Delta T$$

where $C_P$ is the molar specific heat at constant pressure.

### Work ($W$)

Since pressure is constant, the work done is:

$$\Large W = P\Delta V$$

## Isothermal Process

Occurs when heat flows in or out precisely to counteract energy changes from work, making the change in internal energy 0 (and [[0. Internal energy - Temperature|temperature]], since it's proportional to internal energy).

$$\Large \Delta E_{int} =0$$
$$\Large Q = -W$$

> [!hint] **Pressure-Volume Relationship**
> From the [Ideal Gas Law](1.%20Ideal%20Gas%20Law.md), since $nRT$ is constant, $\large pV = \text{constant}$


### Work ($W$)

The work done during an isothermal process is given by:
$$\Large W = nRT \ln\left(\frac{V_f}{V_i}\right)$$

## Adiabatic Process

**No energy is transferred by heat** between the system and its surroundings, meaning the system is thermally insulated from the surroundings and allowed to change volume, doing work.

$$\Large Q = 0$$

So by the **[First Law of Thermodynamics](2.%20First%20Law%20of%20Thermodynamics.md):** 

$$\Large \Delta E_{int} = W$$

### Work ($W$)

Work is equal to change in internal energy in this case, and the formula for that is:

$$\Large W = \Delta E=nC_v\Delta T$$
or:
$$\Large W=\frac{C_v}{R}(P_2V_2-P_1V_1)$$

### What is $γ$?

Basically its a constant that varies for each gas, that tells you how good the gas is at storing energy.

> [!example]
> Some gases might have energy stored as spinning molecules, while other gases might have molecules that can't do that and just have moving molecules.


- **High** $γ$: Gas has fewer ways of storing energy, temperature rises quickly when compressed or heated.
- **Low** $γ$: Gas is good at storing energy, temperature rises slowly when compressed or heated.

An adiabatic compression would move from a lower volume/higher pressure to a higher volume/lower pressure along a steeper curve than an isotherm, and vice-versa for expansion.

> If an adiabatic process also involves no work done ($W=0$), then $\Delta E_{int} = 0$. This implies that the temperature of the gas also remains constant.
