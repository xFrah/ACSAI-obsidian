**Thermodynamic processes** describe how the state of a gas changes with respect to its macroscopic properties such as **pressure**, **volume**, and **temperature**.

> [!hint]
> The **[Ideal Gas Law](1.%20Ideal%20Gas%20Law.md) ($pV = nRT$ or $pV = Nk_BT$)** is fundamental to understanding these transformations. 

> [!note] pV Diagrams
> A **pV diagram** plots pressure ($p$) on the y-axis against volume ($V$) on the x-axis.
> 
> The **[work](../Mechanics/3.%20Work%20&%20Energy.md) ($W$)** done _by_ the gas during a transformation is related to the [integral](../../Calculus%20U2/7.%20Definite%20Integrals.md) of pressure with respect to volume ($\large W = -\int P dV$).

> For processes where the volume changes, the **work done is represented by the area under the curve** on the pV diagram.

### Isochoric Process

Transformation that occurs at **constant volume**.

$$\Large \Delta V = 0$$

Since there is no change in volume, **no work is done ($W=0$)** by or on the gas, and by the **[First Law of Thermodynamics](2.%20First%20Law%20of%20Thermodynamics.md):** 

$$\Large \Delta E_{int} = Q$$

**Heat:** For an isochoric process, the heat exchanged is given by $\large Q = nC_V\Delta T$, where $C_V$ is the molar specific heat at constant volume.

### Isobaric Process

Transformation that occurs at **constant pressure**.

$$\Large \Delta P = 0$$

Since pressure is constant, the work done _by_ the gas is $\large W = p\Delta V$ (or $W = -p\Delta V$ if work is defined _on_ the system), so by the **[First Law of Thermodynamics](2.%20First%20Law%20of%20Thermodynamics.md):** 
$$\Large \Delta E_{int} = Q + W$$

**Heat:** For an isobaric process, the heat exchanged is given by $\large Q = nC_P\Delta T$, where $C_P$ is the molar specific heat at constant pressure.

> If volume increases (expansion), the line goes to the right; if volume decreases (compression), the line goes to the left.

### Isothermal Process

Transformation that occurs at **constant temperature**.

$$\Large \Delta T = 0$$

For an [ideal gas](1.%20Ideal%20Gas%20Law.md), the internal energy depends only on temperature. Therefore, for an isothermal process, the **change in internal energy is zero ($\Delta E_{int} = 0$)**, and by the **[First Law of Thermodynamics](2.%20First%20Law%20of%20Thermodynamics.md)**, heat is given by: 

$$\Large Q = -W$$

> [!hint] **Pressure-Volume Relationship**
> From the [Ideal Gas Law](1.%20Ideal%20Gas%20Law.md), since $nRT$ is constant, $\large pV = \text{constant}$


**Work:** The work done by the gas during an isothermal process is given by $\large W = nRT \ln(V_f/V_i)$ (or $W = -nRT \ln(V_f/V_i)$ for work done _on_ the gas).

> [!note] **pV Diagram**
> All points on the curve have the same temperature. As volume increases, pressure decreases, and vice versa.

### Adiabatic Process

An **adiabatic process** is a thermodynamic transformation where **no energy is transferred by heat** between the system and its surroundings, meaning the system is thermally insulated from the surroundings and allowed to expand further, doing work.

$$\Large Q = 0$$

So by the **[First Law of Thermodynamics](2.%20First%20Law%20of%20Thermodynamics.md):** 

$$\Large \Delta E_{int} = W$$

> [!note] **Special Case: Adiabatic Free Expansion**
> If an adiabatic process also involves no work done ($W=0$), then $\Delta E_{int} = 0$. This implies that the temperature of the gas also remains constant.

> [!hint] **Pressure-Volume-Temperature Relationships**
> For an adiabatic process, the following relations hold:
> 
> $$\Large pV^\gamma = \text{constant}$$
> $$\Large TV^{\gamma-1} = \text{constant}$$ 
> 
> Where $\large \gamma = C_p/C_V$ is the ratio of molar specific heats.

> [!note] **pV Diagram**
> It is generally **steeper than an isotherm** passing through the same point.

> In the diagram above:
> 
> • **Isochoric processes** are vertical lines, like A-D or B-C, indicating constant volume.
> 
> • **Isobaric processes** are horizontal lines, like D-A or C-B, indicating constant pressure.
> 
> • **Isothermal processes** are curves where $p \times V$ is constant, representing a constant temperature. The higher curves correspond to higher temperatures.
> 
> • **Adiabatic processes** would also be curves, typically steeper than the isotherms, passing through different temperatures and having no heat exchange. An adiabatic compression would move from a lower volume/higher pressure to a higher volume/lower pressure along a steeper curve than an isotherm, and vice-versa for expansion.
