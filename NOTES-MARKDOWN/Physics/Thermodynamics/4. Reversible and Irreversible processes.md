## Reversible processes

Idealized processes where the system undergoing the process can be returned to its initial conditions along the exact same path on a [PV diagram](3.%20Thermodynamic%20processes.md), with every point along this path being an equilibrium state.

> [!hint]
> In order to be reversible, there must be no loss of energy to the surroundings.


## Irreversible processes

An irreversible process does not satisfy these requirements. Notably, **all processes occurring in nature are irreversible**.

> [!hint]
> In nature/real world scenarios, we have loss of energy due to [friction](../Mechanics/5.%20Friction.md), thermal non-isolation, ecc...
