The **first law of thermodynamics** states that the change in internal energy of a system is equal to the heat added to the system plus the [work](../Mechanics/3.%20Work%20&%20Energy.md) done on the system:

$$\Large \Delta E_{int} = \underbracket{Q}_{\text{heat}} + \underbracket{W}_{\text{work}}$$
