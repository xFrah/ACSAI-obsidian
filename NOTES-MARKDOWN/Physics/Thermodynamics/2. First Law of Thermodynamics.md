  - first law of thermodynamics

The **first law of thermodynamics** states that the change in [[0. Internal energy - Temperature|internal energy]] of a system is equal to the heat added to the system plus the [work](Work.md) done on the system:

$$\Large \Delta E_{int} = \underbracket{Q}_{\text{heat}} + \underbracket{W}_{\text{work}}$$

> [!danger]
> - Heat is **positive when it flows INTO** the system and **negative when it flows OUT** of the system.
> - When work is done **by the system**, it must be **subtracted from the internal energy** (regardless of formula or conventions).
