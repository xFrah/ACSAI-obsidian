**Cᵥ** and **Cₚ** are the "specific heat capacities" of a gas. 
They measure how much heat energy is required to raise the temperature of the gas by 1°.

## Cᵥ (Specific Heat at Constant Volume)

How much heat energy is required to raise the temperature of the gas by 1° when the container is rigid?

In this case volume doesn't change, so **no work**, and **all heat increases temperature**.


## Cₚ (Specific Heat at Constant Pressure)

How much heat energy is required to raise the temperature of the gas by 1° when the pressure is constant?

In this case volume can change, so **some heat is converted to work**, and **some raises the temperature**.


## Ratio between Cᵥ and Cₚ ($γ$)

First of all, $C_p$ is always bigger (more energy required to raise by 1°) than $C_v$, since $C_p$ raises temperature less in order to do work.

$$\Large γ=\frac{C_p}{C_v}$$

When this ratio equals to:
- 1 - it means that the gas is really good at converting heat to internal energy. Temperature doesn't change (isothermal).
- More than 1 - it means that the gas converts some heat to temperature and some heat to work. 
- Big $γ$ = can't store a lot of energy, which means steep pressure, volume, temperature change.

> [!hint]
> **The bigger γ is, the more dramatically pressure increases when you compress the gas adiabatically**, because temperature has fewer places to "spread out" into.
