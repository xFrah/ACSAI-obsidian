It includes the thermal energy, _i.e._, the [[kinetic energy]] of the particles inside the system (relative to the system).

### How to change it

Without a thermodynamic process, the internal energy of an isolated system cannot change.

The processes that change the internal energy are transfers, into or out of the system, of substance, or of energy, as [[0. Heat|heat]], or by thermodynamic [[work]].


## Temperature

When we talk about internal energy, you can also think of it as temperature, since the two are proportional.

> [!note] Temperature precise definition
> From the **kinetic theory of gases**, by comparing the kinetic-theory-derived pressure equation ($p = \frac{1}{3} \frac{N}{V} m \bar{v^2}$) with the ideal gas law ($pV = Nk_BT$), it is deduced that **temperature is a direct measure of the average molecular kinetic energy**. Specifically, this relationship can be expressed as $T = \frac{2}{3} \frac{1}{k_B} (\frac{1}{2} m \bar{v^2})$.
