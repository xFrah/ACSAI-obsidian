### Vector $\cdot$ constant
$$\large c\vec{V} = (cv_x, cv_y, cv_z)$$

### Sum of vectors

$$\large \vec{V} + \vec{P} = (v_x + p_x, v_y + p_y, v_z + p_z)$$

### Dot/Scalar product

The dot product of two vectors $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{p}$ can be defined both algebraically and geometrically.

**Algebraically**, if $\vec{V}=(v_1​,v_2​,…,v_n​)$ and $\vec{P}=(p_1​,p_2​,…,p_n​)$, the dot product is given by:

$$\large \vec{V} \cdot \vec{P} = v_1p_1 + v_2p_2 + \cdots + v_np_n$$

**Geometrically**, the dot product can be expressed as:

$$\large \vec{V} \cdot \vec{P} = |V| |P| \cos(\theta)$$

where $|V|$ and $|P|$ are the magnitudes (or lengths) of vectors $\vec{V}$ and $\vec{P}$ respectively, and $\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors.

When the vectors are perpendicular $(θ=90\degree)$, the dot product is zero because $cos(90\degree)=0$. 
When the vectors are similar, the dot product is great.
When they go in opposite directions, the dot product is negative.

### Unitarian vector

$$\large U_a = \frac{a}{|\vec{a}|}$$

This gets the unit vector in the direction of a.
$|\vec{a}|$ is the magnitude of the vector.


> [!tldr] What?
> We are dividing a vector by its length to obtain a unit vector of length 1.

### Cross product

Computes a vector that is perpendicular to the two input vectors.
