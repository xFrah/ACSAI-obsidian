## Mechanics

### a)
Here you can do it all using the conservation of energy.
1. Get the kinetic energy of the object after being launched by the spring:
	1. Get force that can be exerted by the string.
	2. Get the potential energy, due to displacement of the spring.
	3. Get the kinetic energy, which in this case is the same as quantity potential energy
2. Get the kinetic energy of the object after going through BC:
	1. Get the friction force
	2. Get the work done by the force
	3. Get kinetic energy difference from work done ($\Large W = \Delta K$).
3. Get potential energy at point D due to gravity, and use conservation of energy to get kinetic energy, and get $v$ from it.
### b)
Just a matter of using the law of accelerated motion to get the the time by plugging in $g$ as acceleration and $0$ as velocity.

### c)
After you get the formula for the velocity at point D and the time of flight, use the law of non-accelerated motion to get the minimum velocity that can traverse distance d at the time the object hits the ground.
Then you plug the velocity inside the formula for velocity at point D, and through the inverse formula you get the compression of the spring.

## Electromagnetism

Electric fields can be measured at any point, in this case we want to measure it at point $P$.
And specifically, we want to find out what charge we must place at point $O$ to have no $\hat{x}$ component for the magnetic field at $p$ (ony vertical electric field).

Magnetic fields add up, and to find out the net magnetic field at a point we just sum their vectors.
So we need to find out the vectors for charge $q$ and charge $2q$.

The formula for the electric field from one of these single charges is:

$$\Large E=\frac{k_eq}{r^2}$$
In this case:
$$\Large r=\sqrt{d^2+L^2}$$
