## 2. Thermodynamics

This section deals with heat, temperature, energy, and the behavior of gases.

- **Ideal Gas Law (PV=nRT)**.
- **Thermodynamic Processes:** Understand and be able to draw pV diagrams for **isochoric (constant volume)**, **isobaric (constant pressure)**, **isothermal (constant temperature)**, and **adiabatic (no heat exchange)** processes.
- **First Law of Thermodynamics (ΔU = Q - W)**: Relates change in internal energy (ΔU) to heat (Q) and work (W).
- **Work Done by/on Gas:** Understand that work is the area under the pV curve. Work is zero for isochoric processes.
- **Internal Energy (ΔU):** For ideal gases, internal energy depends only on temperature. Thus, ΔU=0 for isothermal processes.
- **Heat (Q):** How to calculate heat for different processes (e.g., Q=nCvΔT for isochoric, Q=nCpΔT for isobaric, Q=W for isothermal).
- **Entropy (ΔS):** Definition and calculation, especially for reversible processes or phase changes.
- **Heat Engines/Cycles:** Concepts of efficiency (Carnot cycle).
- **Phase Changes:** Latent heat (fusion, vaporization).
- **Thermal Equilibrium/Mixing:** Calculating equilibrium temperatures when mixing substances.
