Imagine you got a unit circle, and you need to find the components.
Call the angle $\theta$, then then:
- y-component = $\sin\theta$
- x-component = $\cos\theta$

But, you can also switch up the $\sin$ and $\cos$ if you use the complementary angle.

For example if you have angle $\alpha = 90\degree - \theta$:
- y-component = $\cos\alpha$
- x-component = $\sin\alpha$

> [!tldr]
> - If you have the angle **UNDER** the vector, like the unit circle, solve like you are in the unit circle.
> - If you have the angle **ABOVE** the vector, switch sine and cosine.
