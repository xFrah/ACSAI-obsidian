## Momentum

**Momentum** is a fundamental quantity describing the "**quantity of motion**" of an object. 
For a particle of mass $m$ moving with a velocity $\vec{p}$, linear momentum is defined as:

$$\Large \vec{p} \equiv m\vec{v}$$

> [!hint]
> The rate of change of momentum is equal to the net force acting on the object:
> 
> $$\Large \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = m\vec{a} = \vec{F}$$
> 

## Impulse

The **impulse** is defined as the increment of momentum due to an external force. 
It represents the **change in an object's momentum** over a time interval:

$$\Large \vec{I} \equiv \vec{p}_f - \vec{p}_i = \int \vec{F}dt$$

## Conservation of Momentum

For a system of particles, the **total momentum** is the sum of the individual momenta:

$$\Large \vec{p}_{tot} \equiv \sum \vec{p}_i = \sum m_i \vec{v}_i$$

If no **external force** is applied to the entire system, then the total momentum of the system is **conserved** (constant). 
This means that the change in total momentum is zero:

$$\Large \Delta \vec{p}_{tot} = 0$$

> [!hint]
> This **holds even during collisions**, regardless of whether the collisions are elastic or inelastic, **as long as the system remains isolated** from external forces.


## Collisions

A collision results in an exchange of momentum and energy. 
Collisions are **categorized based on whether kinetic energy is conserved**.

> [!warning]
> Momentum is always conserved (if there are no external-forces).


### Elastic Collisions

An elastic collision is one in which the **total [kinetic energy](Mechanics/3.%20Work%20&%20Energy.md#Kinetic%20Energy) of the system is conserved** (in addition to the linear momentum). 

> [!example]
> For two particles, $m_1$ and $m_2$, with initial velocities $v_{1i}$ and $v_{2i}$, and final velocities $v_{1f}$ and $v_{2f}$, both kinetic energy and momentum are conserved:
> 
> $$\Large \frac{1}{2}m_1v_{1i}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2v_{2i}^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_1v_{1f}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2v_{2f}^2$$ $$\Large m_1v_{1i} + m_2v_{2i} = m_1v_{1f} + m_2v_{2f}$$


### Inelastic Collisions

An inelastic collision is one where the **total kinetic energy of the system is NOT conserved** (linear momentum still conserved, with no external forces). 

> [!hint] Where does kinetic energy go?
> Some **kinetic energy is typically transformed** into other forms of energy, such as internal energy (e.g., heat or sound). 

> [!note] Perfectly Inelastic Collisions
> We call a collision **Perfectly Inelastic** when the colliding particles **stick together** after the collision and move as a single combined mass.


## Conservation of Energy in Systems

The principle of conservation of energy states that **energy cannot be created or destroyed**, **only transformed or transferred**.

### Isolated systems

An **isolated system** is defined as one where **no energy crosses its boundary**. For such a system, the **total energy remains constant**:

$$\Large \Delta E_{system} = 0$$

This can be expressed as the sum of changes in kinetic energy, potential energy, and internal energy being zero:

$$\Large \Delta K + \Delta U + \Delta E_{\text{int}} = 0$$

If **no [non-conservative forces](Mechanics/4.%20Conservative%20and%20Non-Conservative%20forces.md)** (like [friction](Mechanics/5.%20Friction.md)) act within an isolated system, the total mechanical energy is conserved, meaning:

$$\Large \Delta E_{mech} = \Delta K + \Delta U = 0$$

> [!warning]
> This concept is frequently used in problems involving motion along inclined planes with or without friction.

### Non-Isolated systems

A **non-isolated system** is one where **energy can cross the system boundary**. 
The general statement of energy conservation for a non-isolated system accounts for all transfers of energy across the boundary:

$$\Large \Delta E_{system} = \sum T$$

Where `ΣT` represents the sum of all energy transfers, which can include [work](Mechanics/3.%20Work%20&%20Energy.md) done on the system (`W`), heat transferred (`Q`), and other forms of energy transfer7. For instance, if a friction force (`f_k`) acts over a distance `d` within a system, the change in internal energy can be `ΔE = f_kd`7. This is relevant when considering scenarios where energy is lost from the mechanical system due to friction, as seen in problems involving dynamic friction8....
