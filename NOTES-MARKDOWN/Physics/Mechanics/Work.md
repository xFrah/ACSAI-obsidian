## Work

We can think of Work as "how much force we applied on this object we're displacing".
Work is a scalar quantity and it's defined as an integral of the force times the distance:

$$\large W = \int \vec{F}\cdot \vec{dr} = \int |\bar{F}||\vec{d}r|\cos\theta=|\bar{F}|\cos\theta \Delta r$$

The simple formula of work done by a force, is given by:

$$\Large W=F\cdot \text{distance}$$

It's measured in **Joules**.

## Work-Energy Theorem

Work is defined as the **transfer of energy**.
And, conversely, we can say that Energy can be defined as **potential to do work**.

The work done on a body is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. It's basically the transfer of energy.
$$\Large W = \Delta K$$
