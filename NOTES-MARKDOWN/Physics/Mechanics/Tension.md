A tension is a force that acts along the length of a medium.
The tension force pulls outward along the two ends of a rope.

This concept can be used to change the direction of forces, or bring together 1 or more forces to have a net force.

## General Tension

Sometimes you have 2 or more bodies connected through a rope or a pulley system.

$$\Large F_{\text{net}}=m_{\text{tot}}\cdot a_{\text{net}}$$

Since **each end of the rope experiences A force (= ma)**, but from different things, you can write **equations detailing the force from the perspective of each end** of the rope

You can either just say that the net force is 

$$\Large F_{\text{net}}=(F-F_{A//})-F_{B//}$$
Or you can write equations for each end of the rope:

$$\Large m_aa_=F-F_{A//}-T$$
$$\Large m_ba=T-F_{B//}$$

> [!hint]
> Each end of the rope has the same accelaration.
