A tension is a force that acts along the length of a medium.
The tension force pulls outward along the two ends of a rope.

This concept can be used to change the direction of forces, or bring together 1 or more forces to have a net force.

## General Tension

Sometimes you have 2 or more bodies connected through a rope or a pulley system.
Remember that **everything has the same acceleration**, and the net force is:

$$\Large F_{\text{net}}=m_{\text{tot}}\cdot a_{\text{net}}$$

Since **each end of the rope experiences a force (= ma)**, you can write **equations detailing the force acting on each end** of the rope.

$$\Large F_{\text{net}}=m\cdot a=50\cdot 2.3$$
$$\Large F_{\text{net}}=T-W=m\cdot a$$
$$\Large T=\underbracket{W}_{mg}+ m \cdot a$$
