$$x(t)=\sin ut$$
$$v(t)=w \cos ut$$
$$a(t)=-u^2\sin ut$$

When my object is at the maximum position, the velocity is 0.

$$\vec{a} // \vec{v}$$
$$\vec{a}=-u^2\cdot x(t)$$

Imagine i have a vector pointing to the maximum altitude, but the acceleration is pointing to moving back. acceleration and position are always anti parallel.
