## Hooke's Law

$$\Large F_x=−kx$$

Describes the restoring force exerted by a spring. The components are:
- $F_x$: The spring force (in Newtons)
- $k$: The spring constant (in N/m), representing the stiffness of the spring
- $x$: The displacement from equilibrium position (in meters)


> [!hint] **Negative sign**
> Indicates the force is a **restoring force** that acts opposite to the displacement.

> [!note] Vector form of Hooke's Law (direction vector)
> $$\Large \vec{F_s}=−kd$$
> 
> This is the vector form of Hooke's Law, where:
> - $\vec{F_s}$: Spring force vector.
> - $\vec{d}$: Displacement vector from equilibrium.
> - The equation emphasizes that force and displacement are in **opposite directions**.

## Work done by a spring

$$\Large W_s=\frac{1}{2}kx_i^2−\frac{1}{2}kx_f^2$$

This formula calculates the work done by the spring force when moving from initial position $x_i$ to final position $x_f$.

> [!hint] Hints
> - Work depends only on the **initial and final positions**, not the path taken.
> - This makes spring force a **conservative force**.
> - The work can be positive or negative depending on whether the spring does work on or against the system

> [!note] Derivation
> The derivation comes from integrating the variable spring force over displacement:  
> $$\Large W=∫F dx=∫(−kx) dx$$

## Potential energy of a spring

$$\Large U_x=\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$

This represents the **elastic potential energy** stored in a deformed spring.

> [!hint] Hints
> - $U_x$: Elastic potential energy (in Joules)
> - Energy is **proportional to the square** of displacement.
> - Maximum energy occurs at maximum displacement (amplitude)
> - Energy is **zero at equilibrium position**

> [!note] Derivation
> $$\Large -\int^{x}_0Fdx=-\int^{x}_0-kx\;dx=\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$
