Recall that work is the "accumulated" force exerted through a distance.
What if we wanted a **work function** that tells us **how much work is needed to get back to equilibrium**?
$$\Large U(x)=-\int F(x)\;dx$$
Where $x$ is the distance from equlibrium / reference point.

Or the difference in potential energy is precisely the negative work done while going from potential energy 1 to potential energy 2.
$$\Large \Delta U=U(b)−U(a)=-\int^{b}_{a}F(x)\;dx=-W$$
