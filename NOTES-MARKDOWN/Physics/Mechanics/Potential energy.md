It's a scalar quantity we use to represent how much force could be exerted due to the force acting through a certain distance.

$$\Large U=-\int^{\Delta x}_{0}F\;dx$$

It's a scalar quantity based on the position or configuration of the object or system.
In terms of work, this represents:
- how much work the object or system has the capacity to do due to its position or configuration, OR 
- how much work was done on it to get it to that state.

## Potential energy for gravity

$$\Large U=\underbracket{mg}_{F}\underbracket{h}_{x}$$
You can do this without integral because the force is constant.

## Potential energy for a spring

Assume we have a compressed string.
0 is the position we are at, $\Delta x$ is the distance that the spring will cover when released.

When released, the spring will exert $F_s$ through distance $\Delta x$:

$$\Large U=-\int^{\Delta x}_{0}F_s\;dx = -\int^{\Delta x}_{0}-kx\;dx=\frac{1}{2}k\underbracket{x}_{\Delta x}^2$$
