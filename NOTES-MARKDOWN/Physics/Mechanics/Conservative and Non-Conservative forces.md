A force is said to be:
- **Conservative**: if **the [work](Work.md) done is independent from the path** it takes, and it just depends on the displacement.
- **Non**-**Conservative**: if the **work is dependent on the path**.

## Conservative forces

In a system of conservative forces nothing is lost:

$$\Large \Delta U + \Delta K = \Delta E^\text{micc}=0$$

> [!hint]
> A conservative force is always the result of variation in potential energy.
> A force is always gonna have the direction of minimizing potential energy.
> This is called potential difference. Forces close the potential differences.


### Gravity

## Non-Conservative forces

The work done on a system does not transform into potential or potential energy, it is transformed into internal energy (**Dissipation**).

For example friction is not a conservative force, the more io put work in a system with friction the more energy it dissipates, it is not preserved.

> [!example] [Friction](Friction.md) example
> Friction does more work the longer the object is dragged.
