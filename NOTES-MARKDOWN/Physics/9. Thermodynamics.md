## Ideal Gas Law

Describes the behavior of gases under certain theoretical conditions.

An **ideal (or perfect) gas** is defined by having **low density** and **short-range forces**, which means that particles that are far apart do not interact significantly.

For $n$ moles of an ideal gas, at a given volume $V$ and pressure $p$, the law is expressed as:

$$\Large pV = nRT$$

Where:

- $p$ is the **pressure** of the gas.
- $V$ is the **volume** occupied by the gas.
- $n$ is the **number of moles** of the gas.
- $R$ is the **universal gas constant**, which has a value of $8.314 \text{ J/(mol}\cdot\text{K)}$. It can also be expressed in other units, such as $0.082 \text{ l}\cdot\text{atm}$.
- $T$ is the **absolute temperature** of the gas, measured in Kelvin.

An **equivalent expression** of the ideal gas law, relating to the total number of constituent particles, is:

$$\Large pV = Nk_BT$$

Where:

- $N$ is the **total number of constituent particles** (atoms or molecules) in the gas.
- $k_B$ is the **Boltzmann constant**, which is derived as $R/N_A$, with an approximate value of $1.38 \cdot 10^{-23} \text{ J/K}$.
- $N_A$ is **Avogadro's number**, which is $6.022 \cdot 10^{23}$ constituent particles per mole.

> [!hint] **Moles** 
> One mole of any substance is defined as the amount of that substance that contains Avogadro's number of constituent particles.

> [!note] Temperature definition
> From the **kinetic theory of gases**, by comparing the kinetic-theory-derived pressure equation ($p = \frac{1}{3} \frac{N}{V} m \bar{v^2}$) with the ideal gas law ($pV = Nk_BT$), it is deduced that **temperature is a direct measure of the average molecular kinetic energy**. Specifically, this relationship can be expressed as $T = \frac{2}{3} \frac{1}{k_B} (\frac{1}{2} m \bar{v^2})$.

## First Law of Thermodynamics

The **first law of thermodynamics** states that the change in internal energy of a system is equal to the heat added to the system plus the work done on the system:

$$\Large \Delta E_{int} = \underbracket{Q}_{\text{heat}} + \underbracket{W}_{\text{work}}$$

## Thermodynamic processes

**Thermodynamic processes** describe how the state of a gas changes with respect to its macroscopic properties such as **pressure**, **volume**, and **temperature**.

> [!hint]
> The **Ideal Gas Law ($pV = nRT$ or $pV = Nk_BT$)** is fundamental to understanding these transformations. 

> [!note] pV Diagrams
> A **pV diagram** plots pressure ($p$) on the y-axis against volume ($V$) on the x-axis.
> 
> The **work ($W$)** done _by_ the gas during a transformation is related to the integral of pressure with respect to volume ($\large W = -\int P dV$).
> 
> For processes where the volume changes, the **work done is represented by the area under the curve** on the pV diagram.

### Isochoric Process

Transformation that occurs at **constant volume**.

$$\Large \Delta V = 0$$

Since there is no change in volume, **no work is done ($W=0$)** by or on the gas, and by the **First Law of Thermodynamics:** 

$$\Large \Delta E_{int} = Q$$

**Heat:** For an isochoric process, the heat exchanged is given by $\large Q = nC_V\Delta T$, where $C_V$ is the molar specific heat at constant volume.

> If pressure increases, the line goes up; if pressure decreases, the line goes down.

### Isobaric Process

Transformation that occurs at **constant pressure**.

$$\Large \Delta P = 0$$

Since pressure is constant, the work done _by_ the gas is $\large W = p\Delta V$ (or $W = -p\Delta V$ if work is defined _on_ the system), so by the **First Law of Thermodynamics:** 
$$\Large \Delta E_{int} = Q + W$$

**Heat:** For an isobaric process, the heat exchanged is given by $\large Q = nC_P\Delta T$, where $C_P$ is the molar specific heat at constant pressure.

> [!note] **pV Diagram**
> If volume increases (expansion), the line goes to the right; if volume decreases (compression), the line goes to the left.

### Isothermal Process

Transformation that occurs at **constant temperature**.

$$\Large \Delta T = 0$$

For an ideal gas, the internal energy depends only on temperature. Therefore, for an isothermal process, the **change in internal energy is zero ($\Delta E_{int} = 0$)**, and by the **First Law of Thermodynamics:** 

$$\Large Q = -W$$

> [!hint] **Pressure-Volume Relationship**
> From the Ideal Gas Law, since $nRT$ is constant, $\large pV = \text{constant}$


**Work:** The work done by the gas during an isothermal process is given by $\large W = nRT \ln(V_f/V_i)$ (or $W = -nRT \ln(V_f/V_i)$ for work done _on_ the gas).

> [!note] **pV Diagram**
> All points on the curve have the same temperature. As volume increases, pressure decreases, and vice versa.

### Adiabatic Process

An **adiabatic process** is a thermodynamic transformation where **no energy is transferred by heat** between the system and its surroundings.

$$\Large Q = 0$$
So by the **First Law of Thermodynamics:** 

$$\Large \Delta E_{int} = W$$

> [!note] **Special Case: Adiabatic Free Expansion**
> If an adiabatic process also involves no work done ($W=0$), then $\Delta E_{int} = 0$. This implies that the temperature of the gas also remains constant18.

> [!hint] **Pressure-Volume-Temperature Relationships**
> For an adiabatic process, the following relations hold:
> 
> $$\Large pV^\gamma = \text{constant}$$
> $$\Large TV^{\gamma-1} = \text{constant}$$ 
> 
> Where $\large \gamma = C_p/C_V$ is the ratio of molar specific heats10.

> [!note] **pV Diagram**
> It is generally **steeper than an isotherm** passing through the same point.

> In the diagram above:
> 
> • **Isochoric processes** are vertical lines, like A-D or B-C, indicating constant volume.
> 
> • **Isobaric processes** are horizontal lines, like D-A or C-B, indicating constant pressure.
> 
> • **Isothermal processes** are curves where $p \times V$ is constant, representing a constant temperature. The higher curves correspond to higher temperatures.
> 
> • **Adiabatic processes** would also be curves, typically steeper than the isotherms, passing through different temperatures and having no heat exchange. An adiabatic compression would move from a lower volume/higher pressure to a higher volume/lower pressure along a steeper curve than an isotherm, and vice-versa for expansion.
