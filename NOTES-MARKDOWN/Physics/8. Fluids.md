**Fluid mechanics** is the study of how fluids (liquids and gases) behave.

> [!quote] Definition of a fluid
> A **fluid** is defined as a substance that **does not have a fixed shape** but instead **assumes the container's shape**. 


## Hydrostatics

**Hydrostatics** specifically deals with fluids at rest.

> [!warning] Ideal Fluid Model
> To simplify the study of fluid dynamics, the concept of an **ideal fluid** is often used. An ideal fluid possesses the following properties:
> 
> • **Incompressible**: Its **density ($\rho$) remains constant** during flow.
> • **Zero Viscosity**: There is **no friction between adjacent layers of the fluid**.
> • **Stationary Law**: The **velocity of each element of the fluid does not vary with time**.
> • **Irrotational**: Its **angular momentum is zero at each point**.


### Pressure in Fluids

A fluid can **exert a pressure on an object** that is submerged in it.
This pressure will always be **perpendicular to the object's surface** and **equal in all its points**.

The above fact is why pressure is defined as the **force ($F$) per unit area ($A$)**: 

$$\Large P \equiv \frac{F}{A}$$

Pressure is measured in **pascals (Pa)**, equivalent to $\large \frac{N}{m^2}$.

### Pascal's Law

It describes the relationship between pressure, depth, and density in a fluid at rest.

If you submerge an object in a liquid, the forces acting along the vertical (y) axis include:
- the gravitational force
- the pressure from the water and atmosphere above it
- the compensating pressure from the water below the object.

This leads to the formulation of Pascal's Law, which states that the **pressure ($P$) at a certain depth ($h$)** within a fluid is given by: $$\Large P = P_0 + \rho g h$$
Where:
- **$P_0$** is the **pressure at the surface** of the fluid (e.g., atmospheric pressure).
- **$\rho$** is the **density of the fluid**.
- **$g$** is the **acceleration due to gravity**.
- **$h$** is the **depth** from the surface to the point where pressure is being measured.

> [!hint]
> A key implication of Pascal's Law is that the **pressure in a fluid at a given depth does not depend on the shape of the object** submerged in it.

> [!hint]
> This law is also related to Bernoulli's formula; specifically, if the velocity of the fluid is zero ($v=0$), Bernoulli's formula simplifies to Pascal's law.


### Buoyant Forces and Archimedes' Principle

When an object is placed in a liquid, the liquid exerts an **upward force** on the object, known as the **buoyant force**.

The buoyant force arises from the pressure difference between the bottom and top of the submerged object.

**Archimedes' Principle** quantifies this force: 

$$\Large B = \rho_{\text{\small fluid}} g V$$
Where:
- **$\rho_{fluid}$** is the **density of the fluid**.
- **$g$** is the **acceleration due to gravity**.
- **$V$** is the **volume of the fluid displaced by the object** (which is equal to the volume of the submerged part of the object).

> [!hint]
> The buoyant force **depends only on the fluid's density and the volume of the object (or its submerged part)**, not the object's mass directly.
> 
> The effect of the buoyant force depends on the object's weight:
> - If the **weight of the object is greater than $B$**, the object will **sink**.
> - If the **weight equals $B$**, the object will be **still (suspended)**.
> - If the **weight is less than $B$**, the object will **float** on the water.

> [!example]
> These principles are applied in various exercises, such as:
> - determining the minimum initial height for a body on a circular guide
> - calculating the speed of water entering a submarine through a hole
> - analyzing a cubic object floating or suspended in water
> - studying the flow in a syringe.
