### Pressure in Fluids

A fluid can **exert a pressure on an object** that is submerged in it.
This pressure will always be **perpendicular to the object's surface** and **equal in all its points**.

The above fact is why pressure is defined as the **force ($F$) per unit area ($A$)**: 

$$\Large P \equiv \frac{F}{A}$$

Pressure is measured in **pascals (Pa)**, equivalent to $\large \frac{N}{m^2}$.

### Pascal's Law

It describes the relationship between pressure, depth, and density in a fluid at rest.

If you submerge an object in a liquid, the forces acting along the vertical (y) axis include:
- the gravitational force
- the pressure from the water and atmosphere above it
- the compensating pressure from the water below the object.

This leads to the formulation of Pascal's Law, which states that the **pressure ($P$) at a certain depth ($h$)** within a fluid is given by: $$\Large P = P_0 + \rho g h$$
Where:
- **$P_0$** is the **pressure at the surface** of the fluid (e.g., atmospheric pressure).
- **$\rho$** is the **density of the fluid**.
- **$g$** is the **acceleration due to gravity**.
- **$h$** is the **depth** from the surface to the point where pressure is being measured.

> [!hint]
> A key implication of Pascal's Law is that the **pressure in a fluid at a given depth does not depend on the shape of the object** submerged in it.

> [!hint]
> This law is also related to Bernoulli's formula; specifically, if the velocity of the fluid is zero ($v=0$), Bernoulli's formula simplifies to Pascal's law.


### Buoyant Forces and Archimedes' Principle

When an object is placed in a liquid, the liquid exerts an **upward force** on the object, known as the **buoyant force**.

The buoyant force arises from the pressure difference between the bottom and top of the submerged object.

**Archimedes' Principle** quantifies this force: 

$$\Large B = \rho_{\text{\small fluid}} g V$$
Where:
- **$\rho_{fluid}$** is the **density of the fluid**.
- **$g$** is the **acceleration due to gravity**.
- **$V$** is the **volume of the fluid displaced by the object** (which is equal to the volume of the submerged part of the object).

> [!hint]
> The buoyant force **depends only on the fluid's density and the volume of the object (or its submerged part)**, not the object's mass directly.
> 
> The effect of the buoyant force depends on the object's weight:
> - If the **weight of the object is greater than $B$**, the object will **sink**.
> - If the **weight equals $B$**, the object will be **still (suspended)**.
> - If the **weight is less than $B$**, the object will **float** on the water.

> [!example]
> These principles are applied in various exercises, such as:
> - determining the minimum initial height for a body on a circular guide
> - calculating the speed of water entering a submarine through a hole
> - analyzing a cubic object floating or suspended in water
> - studying the flow in a syringe.

### Equation of Continuity

The Equation of Continuity describes the **flow of a fluid through a pipe with different sized sections at the same height**.

The equation of continuity states that the **amount of liquid that flows inside the two sections is the same**.

> [!hint]
> This equation means that the **product of the cross-sectional area and the fluid's velocity remains constant** along a streamline. 
> Therefore, if the **area increases, the velocity of the fluid must decrease**, and vice-versa. 
> "The larger the area, the slower is the fluid".

> [!note] How to get the formula
> If a fluid flows through two sections of a pipe (Section 1 and Section 2), the continuity equation can be derived from the concept that the mass flow rate remains constant.
> 1. The amount of liquid flowing can be expressed in terms of volume ($\Delta V$) and density ($\rho$), so $\Delta V_1 \rho = \Delta V_2 \rho$.
> 2. Since density is constant for an ideal fluid, this simplifies to $\Delta V_1 = \Delta V_2$.
> 3. The volume of fluid passing through a section is its cross-sectional area ($A$) multiplied by the distance the fluid travels ($\Delta x$), so $A_1 \Delta x_1 = A_2 \Delta x_2$.
> 4. As $\Delta x = v \Delta t$ (velocity multiplied by time), we get $A_1 v_1 \Delta t = A_2 v_2 \Delta t$.
> 5. Finally, dividing by $\Delta t$, the **Equation of Continuity** is derived as: 
> $$\Large \mathbf{A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2}$$

> [!example]
> This concept is used in problems to determine flow rates. For instance, in an exercise involving water entering a submarine through a hole, "portata" (flow rate) is mentioned as $v_2 A$, which is directly related to this equation.


### Bernoulli's Formula

Bernoulli's formula is a powerful equation derived from the **study of kinetic and potential energy** within a fluid. 
It describes the relationship between pressure, fluid speed, and height in a moving fluid.

For an ideal fluid flowing along a streamline, **the sum of**:
- its **pressure** energy,
- its **kinetic energy** per unit volume,
- its **potential energy** per unit volume...
... **remains constant**.
$$\Large P + \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 + \rho g \Delta y = \text{constant}$$
Where:
- **P** represents the **pressure** of the fluid.
- **$\frac{1}{2} \rho v^2$** represents the **kinetic energy per unit volume** of the fluid, where $\rho$ is the fluid's density and $v$ is its speed.
- **$\rho g \Delta y$** represents the **potential energy per unit volume** of the fluid, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $\Delta y$ (or $h$ in other contexts) is the height.

> [!hint]
> The formula implies that if one term (pressure, kinetic energy, or potential energy) increases, at least one of the other terms must decrease to maintain the constant sum. 
> Specifically, the notes state: "So, if the velocity or the height increases, the pressure has to decrease".

> [!note] **Relationship to Pascal's Law**
> A significant insight is that **if the velocity of the fluid is zero ($v=0$), Bernoulli's formula simplifies to Pascal's Law** ($P = P_0 + \rho g h$) [my previous response, 145]. This highlights that Pascal's Law is a specific case of Bernoulli's formula for fluids at rest.

> [!example]
> Bernoulli's Law is applied in various scenarios, such as calculating the speed of water entering a submarine through a hole. In such a problem, it's applied between the surface of the sea and the hole. 
> When the velocity at the surface ($v_1$) is much smaller than the velocity at the hole ($v_2$), it can be approximated as $v_1=0$. This approximation, combined with the assumption of constant atmospheric pressure ($P_0$), leads to **Torricelli's Law**: $\frac{1}{2} \rho v_2^2 = \rho g X$, or $v_2 = \sqrt{2gX}$, where X is the depth of the hole from the surface.
