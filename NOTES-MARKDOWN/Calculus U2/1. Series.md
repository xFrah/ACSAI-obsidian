## Sequences and series

A sequence is a list of terms:
$$\Large a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n$$
A series is the sum of terms in a sequence, **it equals to a single number** (or $±\infty$):
$$\Large \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}a_n$$
or:
$$\Large a_1+a_2+a_3+\dots+a_n$$

## Convergence of a series

We say that a series **converges** if the partial sums tend to a single number, as we approach infinity.
This happens when the values of the sequence get smaller and smaller until the **cumulative sum barely changes anymore**.

> [!hint]
> Basically the series converges when the **cumulative/partial sum settles on a number**.

> [!example] **Divergence** example

> Here we can see that the **partial/cumulative sum**(right)** continues to grow at infinity**.
> If it were converging, we would see it stabilize on a horizontal line (asymptote).


### Convergence of sequences vs series

We say that a **sequence converges** if:

$$\Large \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n =\text{exists \& finite}$$

The *sequence* above converges to 0. 
But does its *series* converge? **NO**, it never settles (as you can see on the right). 
This is because the **sequence doesn't converge fast enough**.

> The conditions for convergence are:
> - The sequence converges to 0.
> - The sequence converges fast enough.

### If a series converges, its sequence also converges to 0

## Special series

A general series has form:

$$\Large \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}a_n$$

But there are specific patterns to which we gave a name:

### Geometric series

$$\Large \sum^{\infty}_{n=0}ar^n$$
> [!example] Example with $a=1$ and $r=\frac{1}{2}$
> $$\Large \sum^{\infty}_{n=0}1\cdot(\frac{1}{2})^n=1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+\dots$$

##### Convergence criterion

It converges if and only if: $$\Large |r|<1$$
and it converges to this:

$$\Large G_n=\frac{a}{1-r}$$

> [!hint] How to recognize
> 
> Check if the ratio between consecutive tersm is constant.

### P-series
$$\Large \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\frac{1}{n^p}$$
> [!example] Example with $p=2$
> $$\Large \sum^\infty_{n=1}\frac{1}{n²} = 1 + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{25} + \dotsb$$

##### Convergence criterion

It converges if and only if:

$$\Large p>1$$

> [!hint] How to recognize
> You can identify a p-series by checking for terms with a single variable to the power of something in the denominator. 


### Harmonic series

It's basically a p-series with $p=1$:

$$\Large \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\frac{1}{n}=1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\dots$$
##### Convergence

It ALWAYS diverges.

> [!hint] Constant $\cdot$ divergent series
> Even if we have a constant multiplier, the series still diverges.
> $$\Large \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {\frac{5}{n}}  = 5\sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {\frac{1}{n}}$$

> [!hint] Divergent series - finite number
> $$\Large \sum\limits_{n = 4}^\infty  {\frac{1}{n}}$$
> In this case we are subtracting a finite number from a divergent series. This subtraction will not change the divergence of the series. We will either have infinity minus a finite number, which is still infinity
> 
> Of course this extends to addition.

## Power series

A power series is an infinite series of the form:

$$\Large \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n(x-c)^n = a_0 + a_1(x-c) + a_2(x-c)^2 + a_3(x-c)^3 + \dotsb$$

Where:
- $a_n$ an​ are constants called the coefficients of the series
- $x$ is a variable
- $c$ is a fixed point (the center of the series)

##### Convergence

Every power series has a radius of convergence $R$ (possibly 0, finite, or infinite), which is the complete set of $x$-values where the series converges (c−R,c+R):
- For $|x-c| < R$: The series converges absolutely
- For $|x-c| > R$: The series diverges
- For $|x-c| = R$: Further testing needed (may converge or diverge)
