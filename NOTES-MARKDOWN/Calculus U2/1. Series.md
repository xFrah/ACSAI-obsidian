## Sequences and series

A sequence is a list of terms:
$$\Large a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n$$
A series is the sum of terms in a sequence, **it equals to a single number** (or $Â±\infty$):
$$\Large \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}a_n$$
or:
$$\Large a_1+a_2+a_3+\dots+a_n$$

## Convergence of a series

We say that a series **converges** if the partial sums tend to a single number, as we approach infinity.
This happens when the values of the sequence get smaller and smaller until the **cumulative sum barely changes anymore**.

> Basically the series converges when the **cumulative/partial sum settles on a number**.

### Convergence of sequences vs series

We say that a **sequence converges** if:

$$\Large \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n =\text{exists \& finite}$$

The *sequence* above converges to 0. 
But does its *series* converge? **NO**, it never settles (as you can see on the right). 
This is because the **sequence doesn't converge fast enough**.

> [!hint] Conditions for convergence
> - The sequence converges to 0.
> - The sequence converges fast enough.

### If a series converges, its sequence also converges to 0

### If the sequence doesn't converge, the series doesn't converge
