We have a couple of special cases of [definite integrals](7.%20Definite%20Integrals.md) that we call improper integrals. 
Here we explain how to determine their value, or their convergence.

## Infinite interval
$$\Large \int^{\infty}_{a}f(x)\;dx$$
In order to make sense of these, we **replace the infinity with a variable**, do the integral and **then take the limit** of the result as the variable goes to infinity.

### One infinite bound

- Infinite **upper bound**:
$$\Large \int^{\infty}_{a}f(x)\;dx \quad\rightarrow\quad \lim_{t\rightarrow \infty}\int^{t}_{a}f(x)\;dx$$
- Infinite **lower bound**:
$$\Large \int^{b}_{\infty}f(x)\;dx \quad\rightarrow\quad \lim_{t\rightarrow \infty}\int^{b}_{t}f(x)\;dx$$

### Both bounds are infinite

$$\Large \int_{{\, - \infty }}^{{\,\infty }}{{f\left( x \right)\;dx}} \quad\rightarrow\quad \int_{{\, - \infty }}^{{\,c}}{{f\left( x \right)\;dx}} + \int_{{\,c}}^{{\,\infty }}{{f\left( x \right)\,dx}}$$

Where $c$ is any number.

> [!hint]
> After the split, you just have two integrals with one infinite bound each. **Take their limit too**.

### Convergence

These integrals are **convergent** if every associated **limit exists and is a finite number**.

## Discontinuous integrand

$$\Large \int^{b}_{a}f(x)\;dx$$

Assume $f(x)$ is discontinuous somewhere. We can still solve the integral and study its convergence by **avoiding the discontinuous point with [limits](../Calculus/7.%20Limits.md)**.

### Discontinuity on one of the bounds

**Substitute the bound** with a variable and take the **limit from inside the interval**:
- Discontinuous **upper bound**:
$$\Large \mathop {\lim }\limits_{t \to {a^ + }} \int_{{\,t}}^{{\,b}}{{f\left( x \right)\,dx}}$$
- Discontinuous **lower bound**:
$$\Large \mathop {\lim }\limits_{t \to {b^ - }} \int_{{\,a}}^{{\,t}}{{f\left( x \right)\,dx}}$$

### Discontinuity on both bounds

Split the integral in two ($c$ = any number):

$$\Large \int_{{\,\cancel a}}^{{\,c}}{{f\left( x \right)\,dx}} + \int_{{\,c}}^{{\,\cancel b}}{{f\left( x \right)\,dx}}$$

Then **take the limits of both integrals** separately (since they both have [one discontinuous bound](#Discontinuity%20on%20one%20of%20the%20bounds)).

### Discontinuity between the bounds

Split the integral in two again ($c$ = **discontinuous point**):

$$\Large\int_{{\,a}}^{{\,\cancel c}}{{f\left( x \right)\,dx}} + \int_{{\,\cancel c}}^{{\,b}}{{f\left( x \right)\,dx}}$$

Then **take the limits of both integrals** separately (since they both have [one discontinuous bound](#Discontinuity%20on%20one%20of%20the%20bounds)).

### Convergence

A general rule is that an integral is convergent if **every associated limit is convergent**, like [stated here](#Convergence).

## Convergence tests for improper integrals

We can either use limits and solve the integral([Integral test](3.%20Convergence%20Tests.md#Integral%20test)), as described [here](#^58b163) and [here](#^343b34), or we can use convergence tests.

When testing the convergence of these things, you can basically **ignore the integrals** and just focus on the integrands (**you still need to watch out for the bounds or discontinuities**).

### Comparison test

Literally **the same as the normal [Comparison Test](3.%20Convergence%20Tests.md#Comparison%20Test)**.
Just match the integrand (that we **made bigger**) to a p-series.

> If an integrand goes to zero fast enough then the integral will converge.

### Limit test

Literally **the same as a normal [Limit test](3.%20Convergence%20Tests.md#Limit%20test)**.

> Only these 3 tests work in this case here.
