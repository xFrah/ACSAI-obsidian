We now want to ask what function we differentiated to get the function $f'(x)$.
The notation is as follows:

$$\Large\int {{x^4} + 3x - 9} \;dx$$

Where:
- The function to integrate is the one between $\int$ and $dx$.
- $dx$ indicates the variable selected for integration (here it's $x$).

## Properties

### Factoring out multiplicative constants

$$\Large \int kf(x)\;dx\quad=\quad k\int f(x)\;dx$$

> [!hint] Also works if $k=-1$
> $$\Large \int -f(x)\; dx \quad = \quad -\int f(x)\;dx$$

### Sum/Difference property

$$\Large \int f(x)±g(x)\;dx\quad=\quad\int f(x)\;dx±\int g(x)\;dx$$

## How to solve

If the integral is simple, we just guess what the function originated from, by using logic and by knowing how derivatives work. (*and adding $c$ at the end*)

> [!hint] Constant term
> We always add a constant term $c$ in the final result, because any constant will be eliminated by differentiating, and we can't know what it was originally.

> [!example]
> 
> $$\Large\int {x^4} + 3x - 9$$
> We know that:
> - $\large \frac{d}{dx}(\frac{1}{5}x^5)=x^4$ 
> - $\large \frac{d}{dx}(\frac{3}{2}x^2)=3x$
> - $\large \frac{d}{dx}(-9x) = -9$
>   
> So the original function was:
> 
> $$\Large \frac{1}{5}x^5 + \frac{3}{2}x^2-9x+c$$

## Substitution method

Whenever we have an integral of the form:

$$\Large \int f(g(x))\cdot g'(x)\;dx$$

We can use the following rule to solve it:

$$\Large \int f(g(x))\cdot g'(x) \;dx\quad =\quad \int f(u)\;du$$
and the fact that: $$\Large du=g'(x)\cdot dx$$
Then you can solve the simplified integral and substitute $u$ with it's actual value, $g(x)$.

> [!hint]
> $$\Large \Large \int f(\underbracket{g(x)}_{u})\cdot \underbracket{g'(x) \;dx}_{du}\quad =\quad \int f(u)\;du$$
> There are two key points to this:
> - Turning the inner function to $u$
> - Converting $dx$ to $du$ (swapping the differential).
> 

> [!hint]
> While swapping the differential, you need to solve for $dx$ and substitute the result in the integral.
> 
> > [!example]
> If $du=-8x\;dx$, and the integral is $\int x\cdot u^{-\frac{1}{2}}\;dx$, then it becomes $\int u^{-\frac{1}{2}} \cdot (-\frac{1}{8})\;du$

### Pattern recognition in substitution method

This shit is all about recognizing patterns.
For example when you have a fraction, you can **try to make the numerator 1** and make it **match the derivative of something**, for example a $\tan$.
**Or** try to make the denominator 1 so it's **not a fraction anymore** (easier to solve).

> [!hint]
> Usually, things can get eliminated or simplified when you convert $dx$ to $du$.
> When you select $u$ it's usually to kill it's derivative in the numerator, because it will be of the form $dx=\frac{1}{\text{thing you want to get rid of}}\cdot du$.

> [!warning]
> Be sure to know and remember a lot of the derivatives of the trigonometric functions.
