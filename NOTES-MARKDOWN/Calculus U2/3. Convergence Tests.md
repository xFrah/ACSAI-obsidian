## Integral test

If you think about it, the [integral](4.%20Indefinite%20Integrals.md) of $f(x)$ ($\rightarrow \infty$) and the series of $f(x)$ behave the same.

$$\Large \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}f(n)\quad\rightarrow\quad\int^{\infty}_{1}f(x)\;dx$$

So when you take the integral of $f(x)$:
- If it is **finite**, the series **converges**
- If it is **not finite**, the series **doesn't converge**

> [!warning]
> This test can only be applied when $f(x)$ is:
> - Positive
> - Continuous
> - Decreasing
>   
> And the integral is not atrocious.

## p-series test

Just check that the $p>1$.

## Comparison Test

The comparison test lets you determine if a series converges by comparing it to another series whose behavior you already know.

Suppose you have two series:

$$\Large \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}a_n \quad\text{and}\quad\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}b_n$$

- If the bigger series converges, the **smaller one converges too**. 
- If the smaller series diverges, the **bigger one diverges too**.

> We need to **try to relate it to another BIGGER known series**, like a p-series.

## Limit test

Sometimes we can't find use the Comparison Test because we can't find the right inequality. We can use [limits](../Calculus/7.%20Limits.md) instead.

Suppose we have a series $\Large\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}a_n$
We choose another series $\Large\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}b_n$ for which we already know the convergence, and we do this:

$$\Large \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{a_n}{b_n}=L\quad \text{or}\quad \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{b_n}{a_n}=L$$

If $L$ is **positive** and **finite** ($0<L<\infty$), then:
- If $\large\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}b_n$ converges, $\Large\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}a_n$ also converges.
- If $\large\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}b_n$ diverges, $\Large\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}a_n$ also diverges.

If $L$ is $\infty$ , the test is **inconclusive**, and you either need to change test or change $b_n$.

> [!hint]
> Basically if $L$ is finite and positive, we know that the two series behave the same in terms of convergence.

> [!warning] How to choose $b_n$
> It needs to be something that **makes the limit easier to compute**, or something that **behaves CLOSELY the same** as $a_n$.
> 
> > [!example]
> > The limit test for integral:

> > ... is inconclusive when $b_n=\Large\frac{1}{x^3}$, but not when $b_n=\Large\frac{1}{x^{\frac{3}{2}}}$.
> 
> Usually, we would start from $a_n$ and get a **SMALLER** function (opposite to Comparison Test). For example if we use a p that is too large in $b_n$ p-series, the limit will surely go to infinity and make the test inconclusive.

## Alternating series test

Oh my gooood I caaaan't.

## Ratio test

This test is used to test for [absolute convergence](1.%20Series.md#^37da2b), but since an absolutely convergent series is also convergent, we usually use this for testing basic convergence.

We just need to solve this limit:

$$\Large \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}=L$$
Then:
- If $|L| < 1$ the series converges.
- If $|L|> 1$ the series diverges.
- If $|L| = 1$ the test is inconclusive.

# Which test to choose?

![](../z_images/Pasted%20image%2020250504175104.png)

> [!example] Comparison test example
> $$\Large \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\frac{n}{n^3+1}\qquad b_n=\frac{2}{n^2}$$

> [!hint] Limit test tip
> When selecting $b_n$, start from $a_n$ and get rid of lower terms (in denominator and numerator) to make it look like a p-series or geometric series.

## Tips

##### Exponents

> [!tip]
> If you've got an exponent like:
> $$\Large a^{n+1} \quad \text{or} \quad a^{n-1}$$
> Convert it to:
> $$\Large a\cdot a^n \quad \text{and}\quad\frac{1}{a}\cdot a^n$$

> [!tip]
> $$\Large \frac{a^n}{b^n}=\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n$$

> [!tip]
> $$\Large \frac{\sqrt{n^3}}{n^4}=\frac{1}{n^{\frac{5}{2}}}$$
> When dividing, exponents get subtracted. 
> $$\Large \frac{5}{2}=4-\frac{3}{2}$$
