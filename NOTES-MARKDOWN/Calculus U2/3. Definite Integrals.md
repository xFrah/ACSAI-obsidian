## Geometric/Intuitive interpretation

A definite integral equals to the **area under a curve**.
What we are doing is approximating the area by **summing rectangles** that go from 0 to around each point of the curve.
The **smaller the width of the rectangles**, the **better the approximation is**.

## Notation

The **full formula** would be:

$$\Large A = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{n \to \infty } \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {f\left( {x_i^*} \right)\Delta x}$$

Where:
- $n$ is the number of points/rectangles
- $\Delta x$ is the width of the rectangle (which multiplied by $f(x_i)$ gives the area of a rectangle)


But the **actual notation** for a definite integral is:

$$\Large \int^{b}_{a}f(x)\;dx$$

Where:
- $a$ is the lower bound
- $b$ is the upper bound
- $\int^{b}_{a}$ is the area between $a$ and $b$

## How to solve

You can still use substitution to turn it into a simple function and then compute the **difference between the antiderivatives** at the bound points (which gives the **net area**).
The only thing different while using substitution, is that **you need to change the bounds**.
And also you can **avoid to substitute back**, since you changed the bounds.

To be more clear:
1) Solve the integral normally (substitution or other methods)
	- If using substitution make sure to change the bounds:  $a'=g(a)$ and $b'=g(b)$.
2) Once you get the antiderivative $F$, the area is calculated by $F(b)-F(a)$.
