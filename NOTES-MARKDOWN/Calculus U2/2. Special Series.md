## Geometric series

$$\Large \sum^{\infty}_{n=0}ar^n$$

> [!example] Example with $a=1$ and $r=\frac{1}{2}$
> $$\Large \sum^{\infty}_{n=0}1\cdot(\frac{1}{2})^n=1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+\dots$$


It *converges* if and only if: $$\Large |r|<1$$
and it converges to this:

$$\Large G_n=\frac{a}{1-r}$$

## P-series
$$\Large \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\frac{1}{n^p}$$

> [!example] Example with $p=2$
> $$\Large \sum^\infty_{n=1}\frac{1}{n²} = 1 + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{25} + \dotsb$$


It *converges* if and only if:

$$\Large p>1$$

> [!hint] How to recognize
> You can identify a p-series by checking for terms with a single variable to the power of something in the denominator.

## Harmonic series

It's basically a p-series with $p=1$:

$$\Large \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\frac{1}{n}=1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\dots$$

It *ALWAYS diverges*.

> [!hint] Constant $\cdot$ divergent series
> Even if we have a constant multiplier, the series still diverges.
> $$\Large \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {\frac{5}{n}}  = 5\sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {\frac{1}{n}}$$

> [!hint] Divergent series - finite number
> $$\Large \sum\limits_{n = 4}^\infty  {\frac{1}{n}}$$
> In this case we are subtracting a finite number from a divergent series. This subtraction will not change the divergence of the series. We will either have infinity minus a finite number, which is still infinity
> 
> Of course this extends to addition.

## Power series

A power series is an infinite series of the form:

$$\Large \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n(x-c)^n = a_0 + a_1(x-c) + a_2(x-c)^2 + a_3(x-c)^3 + \dotsb$$

Where:
- $a_n$ an​ are constants called the coefficients of the series (basically it's **another series**)
- $x$ is a variable
- $c$ is a fixed point (the center of the series)

##### Convergence

Every power series has a radius of convergence $R$ (possibly 0, finite, or infinite), which is the complete set of $x$-values where the series converges (c−R,c+R):
- For $|x-c| < R$: The series converges absolutely
- For $|x-c| > R$: The series diverges
- For $|x-c| = R$: Further testing needed (may converge or diverge)

> [!hint]
> The series may converge for some values of $x$, but not for others.
> Meaning this is **actually a function** and it's domain may not be $\mathbb{R}$

> [!warning]
> We need to use Ratio test or Root test to check for convergence.

### Tips for applying ratio test

Take as example this:

![](../z_images/Pasted%20image%2020250507102226.png)

You can safely bring $(x+1)^n$ out of the limit, because when you apply the ratio test it becomes 
$$\Large \frac{(x+1)^n+1}{(x+1)^n}=(x+1)$$

Which is a constant, and you can bring it outside of the limit.

Then create the fraction:

$$\Large \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \frac{\frac{(n+1)^2}{\sqrt{(n+1)^2-1}-3^{n+1}}}{\frac{n^2}{\sqrt{n^2-1}-3^n}} = \frac{(n+1)^2}{n^2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{n^2 - 1}- 3^n}{\sqrt{(n+1)^2 - 1} - 3^{n+1}}$$

Now, to solve this integral, you basically need to isolate the biggest term, which in this case is $3^n$ everywhere, and then solve the limit.

In this case:
$$\Large |x+1|\cdot\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left|\frac{3^n}{3\cdot3^n}\right|=|x+1|\cdot\frac{1}{3}$$

In order for the series to converge, the | limit | must be <1:

$$\Large |x+1|\cdot\frac{1}{3}<1$$
$$\Large |x+1|<3$$

So the radius of convergence is 3, now let's find the interval of convergence:

$$\Large -3<x+1<3$$

$$\Large -4<x<2$$
