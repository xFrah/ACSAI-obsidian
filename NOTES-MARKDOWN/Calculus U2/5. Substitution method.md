First, choose something you want to substitute with $u$. We do this to **get rid of composite functions** (or to do [this](#^bcc424)).

$$\Large \int \underbracket{2x}_{d(x^2)}\cos(x^2)\;dx \quad\rightarrow\quad \int 2x\cos(u)\; dx$$

When doing this substitution in an [integral](4.%20Indefinite%20Integrals.md), it's a 2-step process though, we also need to change $dx$ to $du$ through this formula:
$$\Large du=\underbracket{g(x)'}_{2x}\cdot dx$$
Thus using the **inverse formula**:
$$\Large dx=\frac{1}{2x}\cdot du$$
$$\Large \int \cancel{2x}\cos(u)\;\underbracket{\frac{1}{\cancel{2x}}du}_{dx}$$

After you solve the integral, you can substitute back.
**MOST OF THE TIME**, we hope that $g(x)'$ is already inside the integrand, so that we can simplify it when we swap $dx$ to $du$.
In fact, you can see that in the example above, we managed to simplify the $2x$ that was already in the formula.
