We now want to ask what function we differentiated to get the function $f'(x)$.
We show the notation with the following example:

$$\Large\int {{x^4} + 3x - 9} \;dx$$

Where:
- The function to integrate is the one between $\int$ and $dx$.
- $dx$ indicates the variable selected for integration (here it's $x$).

## Properties

### Factoring out multiplicative constants

$$\Large \int kf(x)\;dx\quad=\quad k\int f(x)\;dx$$

> [!hint] Also works if $k=-1$
> $$\Large \int -f(x)\; dx \quad = \quad -\int f(x)\;dx$$

### Sum/Difference property

$$\Large \int f(x)±g(x)\;dx\quad=\quad\int f(x)\;dx±\int g(x)\;dx$$

## How to solve (simple integrals)

If the integral is simple, we just guess what the function originated from, by using logic and by knowing how derivatives work. (*and adding $c$ at the end*)

> [!hint] Constant term
> We always add a constant term $c$ in the final result, because any constant will be eliminated by differentiating, and we can't know what it was originally.

> [!example]
> 
> $$\Large\int {x^4} + 3x - 9$$
> We know that:
> - $\large \frac{d}{dx}(\frac{1}{5}x^5)=x^4$ 
> - $\large \frac{d}{dx}(\frac{3}{2}x^2)=3x$
> - $\large \frac{d}{dx}(-9x) = -9$
>   
> So the original function was:
> 
> $$\Large \frac{1}{5}x^5 + \frac{3}{2}x^2-9x+c$$
