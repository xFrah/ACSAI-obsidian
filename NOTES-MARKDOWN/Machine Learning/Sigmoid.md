A sigmoid is a mathematical function which has a characteristic S-shaped curve:

$$\large\sigma(x)= \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$$

The sigmoid maps the entire x space into a small range such as [0, 1] or [-1, +1], so one use of a sigmoid function is to convert a real value into one that can be interpreted as aÂ probability.
