$$\large \mathbb{R}^2=\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}=\{(x, y),\,x\in\mathbb{R}, \, y\in\mathbb{R}\}$$
$\mathbb{R}^2$ is  set of ordered pairs of real numbers.
We want to describe shapes in terms of relationships between coordinates, or subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ basically. We describe those subsets or relationships using equations.

## Equation of a circle

Below is the notion of distance between two points using Pitagora's theorem:

$P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$
$P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$
$distance(P_1, P_2)=\sqrt{(x_2, x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$

We can use this to derive the equation of the circle on the cartesian plane:
$C = (x_c, y_c)$

$$\large distance((x,y ), (x_c, y_c))=r \quad <=> \quad (x-x_c)^2+(y-y_c)^2=r^2$$
