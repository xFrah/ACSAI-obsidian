## Domain
The **domain** of a function is the **set of inputs for which the function exists** and outputs a real number.

### Domain finding

For the domain we need to avoid:
- division by zero
- square roots of negative numbers
- logarithms of zero 
- logarithms of negative numbers

So basically the domain will be the set of real numbers, minus where these conditions above hold.

## Range
### Range finding

We need to understand the shape of the function and draw our conclusions from that.
