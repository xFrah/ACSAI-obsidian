> [!hint]
> For this exercise, we need to **study the [domain](1.%20Domain%20and%20Range.md)** of the inequality, or **all the values that satisfy the condition**.
> 
> - **Functions**: the domain is all values where the function is defined/makes sense
> - **Sets**: all the values that satisfy those conditions


> [!note] Set notation
> ### Symbols
> - $∈$ means "is an element of"
> - $∉$ means "is not an element of"
> - $⊆$ means "is a subset of"
> - $∪$ means "union"
> - $∩$ means "intersection"
> - $∅$ or { } denotes the empty set
> - $ℝ$ represents all real numbers
> - $ℤ$ represents integers
> - $ℕ$ represents natural numbers
>   
> ### Set builder notation
> In the left side, there is the **superset** we are putting our condition on.
> In the right side, we have a **condition that will shape our subset**.
> - $[a,b] = \{x ∈ ℝ : a ≤ x ≤ b\}$
> - $(a,b) = \{x ∈ ℝ : a < x < b\}$

> [!note] Intervals
> ### Types of intervals
> - [a,b] = all numbers x where a ≤ x ≤ b (closed interval)
> - (a,b) = all numbers x where a < x < b (open interval)
> - [a,b) = all numbers x where a ≤ x < b (half-open interval)
> - (a,b] = all numbers x where a < x ≤ b (half-open interval)
> - (−∞,b] = all numbers x where x ≤ b
> - [a,∞) = all numbers x where x ≥ a
> - (−∞,∞) = all real numbers

## Is our set an interval?

A set is considered an interval if there are no gaps in it.
**Whenever two numbers belong to the set**, **every number between them is also in the set**.

> [!hint]
> Just **express the "domain" in intervals**, and if there is **more than one** then the set itself is **not an interval**.

## When is a set bounded?

Set does not extend infinitely in any direction.

> [!hint]
> Compute the domain and look at the bottom interval and top interval or just the bounds, if neither goes to infinity the set is bounded.

## When does a set have a minimum?

A set is said to have a minimum if it contains an element that is less than or equal to every other element in the set.

Same shit.
