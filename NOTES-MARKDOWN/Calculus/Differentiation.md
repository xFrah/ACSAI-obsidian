$$\Large f'\left( x \right) = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{h \to 0} \frac{{f\left( {x + h} \right) - f\left( x \right)}}{h}$$

This formula is like asking, how much is this function increasing from point $x$ to point $x+h$.
Where $x + h$ is a point that approaches $x$.

The result is a function that gives the slope of the original function at every point.

## When can you differentiate

Differentiability **requires** continuity.
But a continuous function can be non-differentiable.

Basically the left-hand derivative and right-hand derivative of a point must be the same.

> This function is continuous at $x=0$, because it **exists at every point** and the **limit from left and right** is the same.
> 
> But the derivative from left and right isn't the same, because at $x=0$ the slope changes abruptly.
> 
> In this case, the left hand derivative is $f'(x)=-1$ and the right one is $f'(x)=1$. This is called a sharp corner.

## Properties

The **derivative of a sum** is the **sum of the derivatives**:

The **derivative of a scalar product** is the **scalar $\cdot$ derivative** of the function.
