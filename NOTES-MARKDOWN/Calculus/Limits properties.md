This is a limit:

Notice that if we put $x$ to 2, we get a division by zero error. 
We use a limit to understand what is going on around that point.

> A limit is just "plugging" in the function values close to a certain point, to understand what the function looks like when it's approaching that point.

## Some other facts

For polynomials, we just need to evaluate the function at that point.

> Nice enough means that the limit from left and right are always equal and they are also equal to the limit evaluated at exactly that point.

## Solving limits

We saw that there are various limits that we can solve using this:

![](../z_images/Pasted%20image%2020250106191702.png)


But sometimes, this gives $\frac{0}{0}$ as a result, and we need to simplify the limit to avoid the division by zero problem.

The 0/0 is called an **indeterminate form**. This means that we don’t really know what it will be until we do some more work.

**When we take a limit at infinity for a polynomial all we need to really do is look at the term with the largest power and ask what that term is doing in the limit since the polynomial will have the same behavior.**
