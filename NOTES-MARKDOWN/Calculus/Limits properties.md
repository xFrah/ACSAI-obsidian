This is a limit:

Notice that if we put $x$ to 2, we get a division by zero error. 
We use a limit to understand what is going on around that point.

For polynomials, we just need to evaluate the function at that point.

> Nice enough means that the limit from left and right are always equal and they are also equal to the limit evaluated at exactly that point.
