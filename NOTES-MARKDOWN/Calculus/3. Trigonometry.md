> The circumference formula is $2\pi \cdot r$, but in the unit circle $r=1$, so the whole circumference is $2\pi$.

## Pythagorean trigonometric identity

Since the hypotenuse/radius is 1, we can use the pythagorean theorem like this:

## HUGE HINT ABOUT IDENTITY FUNCTIONS

Basically, if you look at the functions $\cos$ and $\sin$, you will notice that they are **the same**, just **shifted**.
So if you look at the unit cicle, you can easily figure them out without memorizing them.
