We must account for the probability of the **first card being hearts or not being hearts**, because in the first case we need to remove a card from our pool of hearts.
So there are **two cases**, and since they are **mutually exlusive** we need to compute their probabilities and sum them.
$$\large P(A\text{ or }B) = P(A) + P(B)$$

We could interpret this as: there are two cases, and we narrow them down further.

With the denominator we restrict the field of possibilities. With the numerator we set the event probability.
So basically we have the probability of the event in that specific set of possibilities.

- In the numerator we have all the combinations of the four numbers
- In the denominator we have all the possible ways to pick four numbers from all the deck.

$$\large \frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{2}=0.25$$

This should follow a binomial distribution, which models the probability of $k$ number of YES in $n$ voters.
