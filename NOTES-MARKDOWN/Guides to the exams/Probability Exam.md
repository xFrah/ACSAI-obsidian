We must account for the probability of the first card being hearts or not being hearts, because in the first case we need to remove a card from our pool of hearts.

Also the events are mutually exclusive so we sum their probabilities.

$$\large P(A\text{ or }B) = P(A) + P(B)$$

We could interpret this as: there are two cases, and we narrow them down further.

With the denominator we restrict the field of possibilities. With the numerator we set the event probability.
So basically we have the probability of the event in that specific set of possibilities.
