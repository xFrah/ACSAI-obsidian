## Information scent

The user's prediction of what a source of information will offer.
It's based on what the user sees at first sight and his background knowledge.

## Discoverability

Don't hide features, put them where the user can see them, and intuitively tell what they are.

## Pages

Navigation between pages must be undoable and must have an history.
Pages are often hierarchical, making us traverse information in a tree-structure.


## Tabs

Tabs are like pages but divided at the root level.
The tab bar is always visible and it is the beginning of a hierarchical navigation.


## Modal views

A modal view is a view for completing a self-contained task.
It appears with an animation from the bottom and disappear when the task is completed or canceled.
**They are called modal because they block what's behind them**.
Alerts are modal.

## Non-modal overlays

They don't block the interface, they just cover a portion of the screen.
They disappear automatically and often go unnoticed.
