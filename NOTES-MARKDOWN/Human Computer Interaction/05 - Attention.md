## Locus of attention

It's a physical object or idea that we are actively and intentionally focused on.

The locus of attention is not entirely voluntary and we must do our best to direct it as we wish.


## Focus as Noun vs Verb

Focus as noun is the currently active element in the UI.

Focus as verb is the action of shifting the locus of attention on something.


## Getting user's attention

The user tends to focus only on some essential aspects of the interface.

Warning and hints are often ignored.


## Automatic tasks

We can do other tasks simultaneously but only one task should require the locus of attention.

So we must predict the locus of attention and do the other tasks automatically or "without thinking".


## Habits

A habit is a task done so many times that it can be executed without thinking.

We should develop the ui with the intent of making habits possible.
