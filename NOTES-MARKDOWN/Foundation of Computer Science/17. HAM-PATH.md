1. I non-deterministically choose all sequences of vertices (in parallel).
2. Look for vertex repetitions and reject if there is one.
3. Check whether the start and end are right, if not reject.

This is polynomial in the size of the input (the number of its vertices).
To check whether a path is good, it is linear. To check all paths, that is quadratic.

This problem is polynomially verifiable, not polynomially solvable thus its in NP.

If you give me an hamiltonian path, we have a [[16. P vs NP#Verifier|verifier]] that is able to check whether or not a non-deterministic "guess" of the first step is correct or not.
