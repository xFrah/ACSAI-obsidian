A context-free grammar (CFG) is a grammar where all rules are of form:

$$\Large \underbracket{A}_{\text{single variable}}\rightarrow \underbracket{X}_{\text{any combo}}$$

This includes all grammars, regular or non-regular.

> [!hint] Difference from [[5. Regular grammars]]
> Regular grammars have stricter rules, which guarantee that the [[3. Regular Languages|language]] associated to the grammar is regular.

> [!example]
> Assume we have a grammar with the following rules:
> 
> - $\large S\rightarrow 0A \;| \;ε$
> - $\large A\rightarrow S1$
> 
> which produces strings like:
> 
> $$\large \{ε, 01, 0011, 000111,\dots\}$$
> 
> This grammar produces the following language:
> 
> $$\large L= \{0^n1^n:n\geq0\}$$
> 
> ...which is **NON-REGULAR**.


## Context-free language

A context-free language (CFL) is a language of some CFG.
