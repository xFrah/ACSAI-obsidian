## Closure properties

A collection of objects is closed under some operation if applying that operation to members of the collection returns an object in the collection.

> [!example]
> In the set of natural numbers, addition is such an operation, while division is not.


Regular languages are closed under the 3 operations above. We want to prove this tho.

> A language accepted by an automata is a set of strings accepted by the automata.
