The question here is:
Are there "non-regular" languages?

Assume we have a example of finite automaton (DFA) like this one:

Is it possible to always guarantee that loop in the middle? 
The answer is **YES**, but we need to prove it.

> You can't guarantee a loop with NFA, because there is no guaranteed path. Especially considering we can have infinite **Îµ** paths.
