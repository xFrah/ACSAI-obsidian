NPC (Nondeterministic Polynomial time Complete) problems are a set of problems that **we strongly suspect to be only solvable in exponential time**, but we **still haven't mathematically proven** that there is a polynomial time solution.

Each one of these problems can be reduced or turned to any other one of them, so if a polynomial time solution is found for one of them, then it is a solution to all of them, which is why this is important.
