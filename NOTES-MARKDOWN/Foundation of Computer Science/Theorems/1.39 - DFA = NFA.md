For any NFA, there exists an equivalent DFA.

$$\Large L(M)=L(N)$$

---

## Proof

The idea here is to demonstrate that we can convert every NFA to a DFA that accepts the same language.
First, we need to remember how the [[2. Finite Automata#NFA to DFA conversion|conversion from NFA to a DFA]] actually works.

Then, we define our NFA and our new DFA:
- $\large N = (Q,Σ,δ,q_0,F)$
- $\large M = (Q',Σ,δ',q_0',F')$

### Building the new DFA

1. We define $Q'$ as a set of subsets of $Q$, essentially a set of groups of states of the NFA ($R$ = state inside $Q$, $r$ = state inside $R$).

2. We define the transition function for the converted DFA as:

$$\Large δ'(R,a) = \bigcup_{r\in R}δ(r,a)$$

> This means that the next state (in the new DFA), given $(R, a)$, is the union of the possible next states (in NFA), given all the $(r, a)$ in $R$.

3. $q_0'$ is a state of $Q'$ that contains ONLY the starting state from the NFA.

$$\Large q_0' = \{q_0\}$$

> [!hint]
> It's a set of states $R$ containing only one $r_i$.


4. $F'$ is a set of states from $Q'$, with each state having at least one accept state from the NFA inside of it.


### Adding the $ε$ arrows

We define $E(R)$ as the set of states reachable from $r$ states (inside $R$) using only $ε$ routes (0 or more).

Now that we have this notation, we need to modify the transition function to include it, we just need to do this: $E(δ(r,a))$.

$$\Large δ'(R,a) = \bigcup_{r\in R}E(δ(r,a))$$

We also need to change the starting state:

$$\Large q_0' = E(\{q_0\})$$

> [!attention] Conclusion
> We have now completed the construction of the DFA $M$ that simulates the NFA $N$. 
> The construction of $M$ obviously works correctly. 
> At every step in the com putation of $M$ on aninput, it clearly enters a state that corresponds to the subset of states that $N$ could be in at that point. 
> Thus our proof is complete.

## TIPS FOR THE ORAL

1. Explain the the DFA simulates the branches of the NFA by "grouping the states" (being in a group of those states means that you could be in any one of those states in the NFA).
2. Explain how these groups work using the transition function

$$\Large δ'(R,a) = \bigcup_{r\in R}δ(r,a)$$

![[Pasted image 20250902144024.png]]

Then you add the $𝜀$ arrows:

$$\Large δ'(R,a) = \bigcup_{r\in R}E(δ(r,a))$$
