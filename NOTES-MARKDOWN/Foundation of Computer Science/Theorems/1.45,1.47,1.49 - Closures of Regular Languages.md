How do i prove that the if A and B are regular, the union(for example) of A and B is still regular?
We create a general [[2. Finite Automata|automaton]] and show that it recognizes the resulting language.

> [!note] Remember
> A language is regular if every string is accepted by at least one automata.

## Proofs

### Closure under union

Let $A=\{good, bad\}$ and $B=\{boy, girl\}$ be two [[3. Regular Languages]].
Their union will be $A\cup B = \{good, bad, boy, girl\}$. 
We need to make an automata that accepts this language, knowing that there are automatons that accept $A$ and $B$.

The solution is to make an automaton that sends the strings to both the automatas that accepted $A$ and $B$. One of the two automata will accept it.

> If you don't construct the transition function in that way (keeping the old transition functions but directing input to the right automata), there could be a situation where the wrong automata accepts strings that are not in the language of the other.


### Closure under concatenation


> [!warning]
> These are not all the possible [[permutations]], only the ones that start with a string from the first set. 


Let $A=\{good, bad\}$ and $B=\{boy, girl\}$ be two regular languages.
Their concatenation will be $A\cup B = \{goodboy, badboy, badboy, badgirl\}$. 

The solution is to make an automaton that accepts the strings that belong to the set $A$ and continue with strings from set $B$.

### Closure under star

Star is the concatenation of a language with itself as many times as you want.

The solution is to take the original automata and make arrows that go from the final states to the initial states. If the string is finished it stays in the accepted state, if not it begins again from the start. 
This can accept every permutation.
