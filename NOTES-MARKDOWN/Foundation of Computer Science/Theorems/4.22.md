A language is decidable iff it is Turing-recognizable and co-Turing-recognizable (its complement is turing-recognizable).

### If $A$ is decidable, both $A$ and its complement $\bar{A}$ are Turing-recognizable

Any decidable language is turing-recognizable, based on the definition in the note above.
And its complement clearly is too.

### If both $A$ and $\bar{A}$ are Turing-recognizable, then $A$ is decidable

Let $M_1$ and $M_2$ two turing machines that recognize respectively $A$ and $\bar{A}$.
We present a decider TM for $A$ that upon input $w$:
1. Runs $M_1$ and $M_2$ in parallel.
2. If $M_1$ accepts, accept; if $M_2$ rejects, reject.
