### From directed to undirected

Assume we have a directed graph G with n vertices, i want to build an undirected graph G', such that G is hamiltonian if and only if G' is hamiltonian.

I split every node in G in 3 new chained nodes in G'.
Then for every original edge in my graph, I add an edge between the third new vertex of each chain to the first vertex of the next node in the original graph

The only possibility is:
- visiting a triple
- moving to another triple (if we go back it's not hamiltonian anymore)
