The assumptions here are:
- $A$ is reducible to $B$ (so $f(w)$ is computable)
- $B$ is in $P$

> [!hint]
> The fact that $f(w)$ exists and is computable, means that we can turn inputs that are accepted from the decider of $A$, to inputs that are accepted from the decider of $B$.

> [!hint] **USING THE DECIDER OF B TO MAKE A DECIDER FOR A**
> A is a problem (language), the decider for this problem can be whatever we want. In this case we use the decider of $B$ to create a decider for $A$.


We want to show that if this is the case, $A$ is in $B$ too.

First, we describe the decider for $A$:
- On input $w$, compute $f(w)$.
- Run the decider for $B$ on $f(w)$ and output what $M$ outputs.
