### From HAM-CYCLE to TSP

We start with the graph $G$ from the ham-cycle, and we complete it (we add all the missing edges), to **get a fully connected graph** $G'$ (because TSP has a fully connected graph).

> Since this is a fully connected graph, there is always an ham-path (but we don't really give a shit).


If an edge was present in $G$, its cost is 0, if it was not, its cost is 1.
The point is that we sum all the paths that we take, and if the cost of the entire path is 0, it means that we found a path that was in $G$.

The conclusion is that $G$ has a hamiltonian cycle if and only if $G’$ has a tour of cost 0.
