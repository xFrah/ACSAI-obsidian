We start with the graph from the ham-cycle, and we complete it (we add all the missing edges), to get a fully connected graph.

If an edge was present in the original graph, its cost is 0, if it was not, its cost is 1.
The point is that we sum all the paths that we take, and if the cost of the entire path is 0, it means that we found a path that was in the original graph.
