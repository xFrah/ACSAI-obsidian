Assumptions:
- $B$ is NP-complete (every language in NP is pol. reducible to $B$)
- $C$ is in NP
- $B$ is pol. reducible to $C$ ($B\leq_PC$).

**We want to prove that since $B$ is reducible to $C$, $C$ is NP-complete too**.

Polynomial time reductions work like this:
If $A$ is polynomial time reducible to $B$, and $B$ is polynomial time reducible to $C$, then $A$ is polynomial time reducible to $C$.

So since every member of NP is reducible to $B$, since $B$ is reducible to $C$, every member of NP is also reducible to $C$, making $C$ NP-complete.
