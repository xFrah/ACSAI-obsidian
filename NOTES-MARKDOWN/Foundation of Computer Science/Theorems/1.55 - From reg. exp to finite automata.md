For every regular expression $R$ there exists a NFA $N$ such that $L(R) = L(N)$. And so that the language is regular.

We show that we can always convert the expression to an automaton, that accepts the language generated by the expression.

## Proof

Say that we have a **regular expression R** that describes a language $A$.
We consider the six cases in the formal definition of regular expressions:
1. **One character**:

$$\Large R=a, \quad a \in \Sigma$$
$$\Large L(R)=\{a\}$$
> [!hint]
> When the regular expression consists of only 1 symbol, it will only match that symbol.


And the NFA that recognizes this, is simply:

2. **Empty string / No character**:

$$\Large R=ε$$
$$\Large L(R)=\{ε\}$$

The NFA that recognizes this is:

![[Pasted image 20250811174816.png]]![[Pasted image 20250811174850.png]]


3. **Empty language**:

$$\Large R=∅$$
$$\Large L(R)=∅$$

The corresponding NFA must not accept any string, since the language is empty. So we construct an NFA with no accepting/finish state:

![[Pasted image 20250811175435.png]]![[Pasted image 20250811175501.png]]


4. $R =R1∪R2$
5. $R =R1◦R2$
6. $R =R_1^∗$

For the last three cases, we use the constructions given in the proofs that the class of regular languages is closed under the regular operations. In other words, we construct the NFA for R from the NFAs for R1 and R2 (or just R1 in case 6) and the appropriate closure construction.
