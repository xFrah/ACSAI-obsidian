I want to invent a new graph such that G has a clique of size k if and only if G' has a vertex cover of size k'.

G' will be the complement of G. Same vertices, but with edges where the original graph doesn't have edges.

G has a clique of size k, if and only if the complement of G has a vertex cover of size |V| - k.

Imagine that G has a clique of size V' of size k.
We claim that V\V' is a vertex cover for G.
Why?
Let {u,v} be any edge in the complement of E, so it was not in E to begin with.
I fix an edge in the complement graph, and since this edge is not present in the original graph, at least one of them will be outside the clique.

Now the other side.
We take a pair of vertices that do not belong to V'. 
He's speaking too much symbols, i am not understanding.
