I want to invent a new graph such that $G$ has a clique of size k if and only if $\bar{G}$ has a vertex cover of size k'. This graph will be the complement of the original graph.

We call $\bar{G}$ the complement of $G$: same vertices, but with edges where $\bar{G}$ doesn't have them.

$G$ has a clique of size $k$, if and only if $\bar{G}$ has a vertex cover of size $|V| - k$.

### Clique to Vertex cover

Imagine that $G$ has a clique V' of size k.
1. Imagine any edge in $\bar{G}$.
2. These edges were not present in $G$.
3. So at least one of their endpoints wasn't in the clique, since for them to be both in the clique, they would have needed to be at least connected, but they weren't.
4. So every edge of $\bar{G}$ touches at least one endpoint that wasn't in any clique. 
5. So we have this set $V \;/\; V'$, which all edges on $\bar{G}$ touch (one of the endpoints of each edge isn't in the clique, so it must be in $V \;/\; V'$), making this a vertex cover.

### Vertex cover to Clique

Suppose we have a vertex cover $V'$ in $\bar{G}$. We want to prove the verteces ouside $V'$ form a clique in $G$.
Since this is a vertex cover, each edge in $\bar{G}$ must have at least one endpoint in $V'$.
Since both verteces are for sure outside of the vertex cover, it means that there can't exist an edge between them, or one of them would be in the vertex cover.

> [!hint]
> We want to demonstrate that each pair of verteces inside the clique $V \;/\; V'$ have an edge between them. But they can't since one of the verteces would need to be in $V'$. Since each edge MUST have an endpoint in the vertex cover.
