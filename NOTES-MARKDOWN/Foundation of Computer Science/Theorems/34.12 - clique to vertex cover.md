I want to invent a new graph such that $G$ has a clique of size k if and only if $\bar{G}$ has a vertex cover of size k'. This graph will be the complement of the original graph.

We call $\bar{G}$ the complement of $G$: same vertices, but with edges where $\bar{G}$ doesn't have them.

$G$ has a clique of size $k$, if and only if $\bar{G}$ has a vertex cover of size $|V| - k$.

Imagine that $G$ has a clique V' of size k.
1. Imagine any edge in $\bar{G}$.
2. These edges were not present in $G$.
3. So at least one of their endpoints wasn't in the clique, since for them to be both in the clique, they would have needed to be at least connected, but they weren't.
4. So every edge of $\bar{G}$ touches at least one endpoint that wasn't in the clique. 
5. So we have this set $V \;/\; V'$, which all edges on $\bar{G}$ touch, making this a vertex cover.




We claim that V\V' is a vertex cover for G.
Why?
Let {u,v} be any edge in $\bar{E}$, so it was not in $E$ to begin with.
I fix an edge in the complement graph, and since this edge is not present in the original graph, at least one of them will be outside the clique.

Now the other side.
We take a pair of vertices that do not belong to V'. 
He's speaking too much symbols, i am not understanding.
