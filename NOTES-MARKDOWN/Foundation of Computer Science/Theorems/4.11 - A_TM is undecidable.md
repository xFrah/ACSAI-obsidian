$$\large A_{TM} = \{⟨M,w⟩\;| \;M\text{ accepts input }w\}$$

First we show that it's recognizable.
Obviously we can have a TM that upon input $⟨M,w⟩$:
1. Runs $M$ on $w$.
2. If it accepts, accept.

> If it rejects, reject; otherwise $M$ can loop forever.

Now we show that it's not decidable using a proof by contradiction.
Assume we have a TM $H$ that decides $A_{TM}$.

Since $H$ a decider, upon input $⟨M,w⟩$ it will:

Now we construct another TM $D$, which can run $H$ as a subroutine:

This TM $D$, upon in put $⟨M⟩$, basically runs $M$ using the string encoding of $M$ (written $⟨M⟩$) as input, and outputs the opposite of the result of $M$.
Which is completely useless.

But, when we run use $D$ with input $⟨D⟩$, we can actually see that:
- $H$ is ran to decide whether $D$ accepts input $⟨D⟩$
- If $H$ accepts, it means that $D$ should accept $⟨D⟩$. But in the case $H$ accepts, then $D$ rejects. So this isn't possible (and viceversa).

Thus, there cannot exist any decider $H$ for $A_{TM}$.

$$\large ⟨D⟩ ∈ L(D)\text{ if and only if }⟨D⟩ ∉ L(D)$$
