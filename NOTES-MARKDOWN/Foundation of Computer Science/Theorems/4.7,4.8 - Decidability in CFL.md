Here, we describe [[algorithms]] to determine whether a CFG generates a particular string and to determine whether the language of a CFG is empty.

## Membership in [[Context-Free Grammars|CFG]]

$$\large A_{CFG} = \{⟨G,w⟩\;| \;G\text{ is a CFG that generates string }w\}$$
For CFG G and string w, we want to determine whether G generates w.

> [!warning]
> One idea is to use G to go through all derivations to determine whether any is a derivation of w. 
> This idea doesn’t work, as **infinitely many derivations may have to be tried**. If G does not generate w, this algorithm would never halt. This idea gives a [[Turing Machines|Turing machine]] that is a recognizer, but not a decider, for $A_{CFG}$.


If G is in Chomsky Normal Form, any derivation of a string of length $n$ has precisely $2n-1$ steps.

So we just check all derivations with $2n-1$ steps, which exist in finite numbers.

We present a [[Turing Machines|TM]] $S$ that upon input $⟨G,w⟩$:
1. Convert $G$ to Chomsky Normal Form.
2. List all derivations of $G$ with $2n-1$ steps ($n=|w|$) (except if $n=0$, then list all derivations with 1 step).
3. If any of these derivations generate $w$, accept; reject otherwise.

> [!note]
> The problem of determining whether a CFG generates a particular string is related to the problem of compiling programming languages.

## Emptiness in [[Context-Free Grammars|CFG]]

We can show that the problem of determining whether a CFG generates any strings at all is decidable.

$$\large E_{CFG} = \{⟨G⟩\;|\; G \text{ is a CFG and } L(G) = ∅\}$$
