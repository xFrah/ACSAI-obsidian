A verifier is deterministic, but the NP definition tells us about a non deterministic decider. We will show that the two definitions are the same.

## $\rightarrow$ (construct the verifier from the NTM)

We need to construct the verifier from the existing Non-Deterministic TM that accepts it.
We just take the Turing machine, we simulate it on problem $w$ and we make it follow $c$ step by step.
If the TM accepts, the verifier accepts.

## $\leftarrow$ (construct the NTM from the verifier)

We need to construct the Non-Deterministic TM from an existing verifier.
Run infinitely many instances of the verifier over all the possible candidates, if one accepts, accept.
