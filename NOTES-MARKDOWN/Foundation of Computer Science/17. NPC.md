SAT is NP complete, since we know from Cook-Levin theorem.


## 3-CNF-SAT

We reduce SAT to a subset of it, 3-CNF-SAT, and we use that for proving that everything else is in NP too.

Handling all the forms of the formulas in SAT problem is hard, in practice.
To simplify this, we only input formulas in [[CNF]] (Conjunctive Normal Forms).

The cool thing of CNF is that for it to be satisfiable, at least one literal in each clause is 1. Even though if this simplifies stuff, it is still NP-Complete.
3-CNF is the last model for which it is still NP-Complete (2-CNF is polynomial)


## CLIQUE

Basically a clique is a set of vertices in a graph such that all the vertices inside of the set are connected.
They can be of different sizes, every edge is a clique of size 2.

The certificate is the proposed clique. Check that every vertex belongs to the graph, check that clique has correct size, check that every edge that you find is in the set of edges.

We can show that 3-CNF-SAT reduces to clique ($\text{3-CNF-SAT} \leq_P \text{CLIQUE}$).

(G, k) with k as the number of clauses in my formulas.
We need to find formulas that are satisfiable if and only if bla bla bla

## VERTEX-COVER

A vertex cover is a set of vertices that is connected to all leaves in the graph. We want to find the smallest vertex-cover, the smallest number of nodes that can cover all the graph.

We can convert this to a decision problem: does this graph have a vertex cover of size k?

## HAM-PATH

![[Pasted image 20250901163220.png]]

1. I non-deterministically choose all sequences of vertices (in parallel).
2. Look for vertex repetitions and reject if there is one.
3. Check whether the start and end are right, if not reject.

This is polynomial in the size of the input (the number of its vertices).
To check whether a path is good, it is linear. To check all paths, that is quadratic.

This problem is polynomially verifiable, not polynomially solvable thus its in NP.

If you give me an hamiltonian path, we have a [[16. P vs NP#Verifier|verifier]] that is able to check whether or not a non-deterministic "guess" of the first step is correct or not.

## Undirected HAM-PATH

Edges are not pairs of vertices (ordered), they are just subsets of vertices now.
Basically edges are not directed anymore.

## HAM-CYCLE

HAM-PATH, but the start and stop node are connected by an edge.

### Reduction from HAM-PATH

My original graph has n vertices, i add 1, between the first and last nodes (which should touch because this is a cycle): 
$$\Large u_1, \dots, t,v,s,\dots,u_n+2$$


If i have an ham-path from s to t in G, trivially, from v to s (passing through all the ham-path) and then to t...
I simply forget the first and last edge, and what remains is an ham-path. 
This is trivial if v is outside, but if the cycle starts from some internal node u, then?


## TSP (traveling salesman)

A salesman must visit the n cities with the lowest cost tour.
So basically we must find the path that touches some vertices with the lowest cost possible (all vertices must be touched once).

We assume that we have a complete graph, so you can go from every city to every other city.
