## P

P is the set of [[11. Problems as Languages#Decision problems|DECISION PROBLEMS]] for which we have a decider that runs in polynomial time ($O(n^k)$) on a Deterministic [[9. Turing Machines|TM]], that is, THE [[12. Algorithms|ALGORITHM]] OUTPUTS A **YES OR NO ANSWER**.

Membership for P can ve verified efficiently. ^decision

## NP

NP is the same thing, but the decider is non-deterministic.
This means that the decider can theoretically **simultaneously check all the possible paths** or branches (every branch uses at most polynomially many stages.), and accept in polynomial time.

Verifying a solution is efficient. ^verification
While the number of certificates are exponential.

### Verifier

A verifier is a deterministic turing machine that can tell whether a "guess" is a solution or not in polynomial time.

![[Pasted image 20250831181054.png]]

Where:
- $w$ is the input string
- $c$ is the certificate, which is basically the non-deterministic "guess" to verify.

> [!example] Usage example
> On input $⟨w, c⟩$, where $w$ and $c$ are strings: 
> Simulate $N$ on input $w$, treating each symbol of $c$ as a description of the nondeterministic choice to make at each step.

## Polynomial reducibility

Meaning that you can **map the input of A to an input of B** (using function $f$) and **B can still run its decider on it in polynomial time** (mapping + solving is still polynomial).

## P vs NP

Is [[#^verification|verification]] the same as [[#^decision|decision]]?
