When we want to describe a syntax, we can use generative grammars, which make use of their recursive structure and substitutions to "generate" valid entities.

> [!note]
> Regular grammars are specifically designed to generate strings that belong to [[regular languages]].Â They have a specific structure in their production rules that limits the types of strings they can produce to those that can be recognized by a finite [[Finite Automata]].

> [!hint]
> Used by compilers to parse code with the correct syntax.

> [!example] Grammar for natural numbers
> These are the rules, components on the right will replace components on the left:

> 
> $$\large a ::= b \quad \text{means b can replace a}$$
> $$\large \text{| means OR}$$
> $$\large \text{a space between two entities means concatenation}$$
>

> > But since 1903 is not a single **DIGIT**, we substitute with **NONZERODIGIT DIGITSEQ**.

## Right-Linear vs Left-Linear grammars

There are two different ways of recursively generating a language or entity:

- By recursively appending on the right (**right-linear**)
- By recursively appending on the left (**left-linear**)

> [!example]
> The regular language $0(10)^*$ can be generated in two ways:
> - We **start from the left** with $0$ and then check recursively for $10$'s
>   
> 	![](../z_images/Pasted%20image%2020241119113011.png)
> 
> - We **start from the right** by checking recursively for either $10$ or $0$.
>   
>   ![](../z_images/Pasted%20image%2020241119113150.png)
>   
> With the right-linear grammar:
> - Start from **S**
> - Check for **0**
> - Start recursion for finding a sequence of **10**'s, if we find a **10** continue the recursion.
>   
> With the left-linear grammar:
> - We start from **S**
> - We check for either **10** or **0** recursively.
> - If we find a a **10**, continue the recursion.
