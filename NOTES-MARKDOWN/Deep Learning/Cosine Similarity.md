Operation to measure closeness between two vectors, its different from the distance.

$$\large Sc(x,y) = \cos\theta$$

Where $\theta$ isthe angle betrween $a$ and $b$.

You can also compute it as:

(a circle b) / ||a|| + ||b||

- Cosine similarity of 1 means very similar
- Cosine similarity of 0 means opposite.

How do we find the wordl2vec embedding?
A: We use a feed forward neural netowk to solve a problem we don't care about.


> [!example]
> Given the words x and y, how likely is it that x and y appear close to each other?
> Idea: Words come with context.
