The average of the squared deviations from the mean, obtained with:

$$\Large \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\mu)^2 $$

Where:
- **Xi** – a single value of x.
- **μX** – the mean (average) of the X-variable.


```ad-hint
The only difference between this and the [standard deviation](Standard%20Deviation.md) is that the latter is rooted.
