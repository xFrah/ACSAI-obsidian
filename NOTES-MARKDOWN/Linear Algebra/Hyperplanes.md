In an $D$-dimensional space, an hyperplane has $D-1$ dimensions and divides the space in two halves.

In the case of a 2D space, it's a line. In the case of 3D space it's a plane.

The formula for an hyperplane is
$$\large 𝐰𝐱+𝐛=0$$

Where 𝐰 is the [vector](Vectors.md) normal to the hyperplane and 𝐛 is an offset.
