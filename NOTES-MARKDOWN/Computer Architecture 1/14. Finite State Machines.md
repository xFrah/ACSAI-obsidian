A circuit that has 3 parts:
- **Next state** circuit
- **Output** circuit
- State **register**

Basically it's a machine that changes its state and output based on the input and the previous state.
There are two types of FSM:
- **Moore** FSM: Only uses **current state** to choose the output.
- **Mealy** FSM: Uses both the **current input** and the **current state** to choose the output

## Moore FSM

You input, you get into a state, you output the output that corresponds to this state.

> 1. Turn the state column into n columns where n are the bits necessary to encode the index of the states. In this case the **max index is 3**, so **11**:

## FSM circuit representation

The following diagram is a high level representation of a Moore FSM, we will go into details:

1. **STATE REGISTER**: it goes in the middle and holds the current state.

2. **NEXT STATE LOGIC**: it selects the next state based on the inputs.

![](../z_images/Pasted%20image%2020250203113845.png)


3. **OUTPUT LOGIC**: it selects the output based on the current state (in moore fsm).

## Mealy FSM

In the Moore FSM, the arcs between states indicated the input, now they indicate both input and output:

When you work with Mealy FSM, you need to specify the output table:
