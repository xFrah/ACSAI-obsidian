A circuit that has 3 parts:
- **Next state** circuit
- **Output** circuit
- State **register**

Basically it's a machine that changes its state and output based on the input and the previous state.
There are two types of FSM:
- **Moore** FSM: Only uses **current state** to choose the output.
- **Mealy** FSM: Uses both the **current input** and the **current state** to choose the output

## Moore FSM

You input, you get into a state, you output the output that corresponds to this state.

> Ask yourself, for each next state column, when is this true, and you literally write the "minterms" for when the column is true.

## FSM circuit representation

The following diagram is a high level representation of a Moore FSM, we will go into details:

1. **STATE REGISTER**: it goes in the middle and holds the current state.

2. **NEXT STATE LOGIC**: it selects the next state based on the inputs.

3. **OUTPUT LOGIC**: it selects the output based on the current state (in moore fsm).
