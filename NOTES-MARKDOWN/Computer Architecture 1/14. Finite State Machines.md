A circuit that has 3 parts:
- **Next state** circuit
- **Output** circuit
- State **register**

Basically it's a machine that changes its state and output based on the input and the previous state.
There are two types of FSM:
- **Moore** FSM: Only uses **current state** to choose the output.
- **Mealy** FSM: Uses both the **current input** and the **current state** to choose the output
