In contrast to [combinatorial circuits](3.%20Combinational%20circuits.md), sequential ones have "memory" and can act based on previously stored bits.

## Latch

^621042

Latches are circuits that depend on their current input signals and a previously stored bit. 
The output can change immediately with the input lanes.
### SR Latch (set/reset)

![](../z_images/Pasted%20image%2020250120141259.png)

There are 4 possible cases:
- Set = 1, Reset = 0

- Set = 0, Reset = 1

- Set = 0, Reset = 0

- Set = 1, Reset = 1

Set = 1 makes the value 1
Reset = 1 makes the value 0
Set and reset = 0 keeps the old values

### D Latch

It has a CLK lane and a D lane.
- CLK controls whether the output must change or not
- The D lane is what to change the output to.

## Flip flops

The difference between latches and flip flops, is that the latter changes it's state **after a rising edge** of the clock signal (from **0 to 1**), while latches respond immediately to the levels of the input signals.

### D flip-flop

> [!hint]
> - CLK = 0: the control lane of N1 is up, so **D can pass through N1** (but not through N2).
> - CLK = 1: the control lane of N1 goes down (**sampling the current N1 D lane**) and the control lane of N2 goes up, so the **signal gets passed to N2**.
>   
> So what this D flip-flop is actually doing, is outputting the first D signal from Q, but only when CLK goes from 0 to 1.
> 
> It can also go back to 0 and it will still be outputting the same signal.


You can also use this to make registers:

### Enabled flip flops

The D flip flop always captures D at a rising edge of CLK.
What if you don't want to change the values? You use a [multiplexer](10.%20Multiplexer.md) to control the input signal.

- EN = 1: D passes through to Q on the clock edge

- EN = 0: the flip-flop retains its previous state

> [!hint] Why don't we just stop CLK from rising?
> Good question! It's because gating (messing with) the clock is not very nice and it could lead to timing issues.

## Synchronous and Asynchronous sequential circuits

To handle re-input of outputs in a way that doesn' cause race conditions, we use a mix of combinatorial logic and registers to create sequential circuits.
