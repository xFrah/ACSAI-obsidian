## Combinational circuits

The output depends solely on current input.
They can be expressed with **diagrams**, **truth tables** and **boolean equations**.

> [!example] Priority circuit example
> A priority circuit is a circuit only has 1 line activated, which is the line that corresponds to the fist activated input line.

### Contention

When the circuits sets a line to both 1 and 0, causing unpredictable behaviour.
This is denoted by X, same as the "don't care"s, so you need context to tell them apart.
