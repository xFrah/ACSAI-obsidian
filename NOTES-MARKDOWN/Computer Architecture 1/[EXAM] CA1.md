This exercise is actually asking you to:
- Make an [FSM](14.%20Finite%20State%20Machines.md) for the problem
- Turn it into transition table
- Make the sequential circuit for the FSM, specifically the next state circuit and the output circuit with [PLA](8.%20PLA.md), or [Decoder](11.%20Decoder.md).

This exercise is asking you to:
1. Compute the formulas for each output given the FSM (Skip if you have a decoder already)
2. Turn the formulas into a state transition table
3. Draw the FSM
