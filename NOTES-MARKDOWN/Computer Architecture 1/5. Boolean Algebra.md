[SOP](4.%20SOP%20&%20POS.md) and [POS](4.%20SOP%20&%20POS.md) are useful and simple, but they might not produce the simplest set of logic gates.

So we have axioms and theorems to simplify boolean expressions.

## Proving these theorems true

We can do so by *either*:
- Perfect induction: **We compare the two truth tables**, and if they produce the same output for every possible input, they are the same.
- We use other theorems or axioms to **make one side look like the other**.

## Simplifying boolean equations

> [!info]
> The term implicant means product of literals.

By simplifying an equation, we mean **reducing the number of implicants and the literals inside of them to the minimum**.

Often, to simplify a boolean equation, we can **expand it** using theorems to **then re-simplify** it in another way.
