It's a technique used to minimize [boolean equations](6.%20Boolean%20Algebra.md) graphically.

We plot the karnaugh map, which is standard until we put the actual values in:

> Note that the columns and rows of the table are not in numerical order, but a special order that insures that at most 1 digit differs from one column or row index to the other.

## Minimizing a truth table through the k-map

We fill the map with outputs from this truth table:

And the result is:
![](../z_images/Pasted%20image%2020250113161247.png)


Now we need to **circle the ones** in this way, make sure to **cover all the ones**, and find the [minterm](5.%20SOP%20&%20POS.md#^minterm-maxterm-literal) for each circle, then you will have the equation:

## POS form

Karnaugh maps can also be used to compute a [POS equation](5.%20SOP%20&%20POS.md#POS%20(product%20of%20sums)).
We circle 0's instead of 1's and we write the [maxterm](5.%20SOP%20&%20POS.md#^minterm-maxterm-literal) instead of minterms.

> - Each square represents a maxterm.
> - Each covering represents a SUM.

Here is the basic karnaugh map:
