It's a technique used to minimize [boolean equations](5-6.%20Boolean%20Algebra.md) graphically.

We plot the karnaugh map, which is standard until we put the actual values in:

## Minimizing a truth table through the k-map

We fill the map with outputs from this truth table:

And the result is:

Now we need to **circle the ones** in this way, make sure to **cover all the ones**, and find the minterm for each circle, then you will have the equation:

> [!hint] How to find the equation?
> Look at the circles, for each one, **look at what variable changes between the cells**, you must **not include it** in the minterm generated by the circle.
> 
>> [!example]
>  In this case, for the vertical circle, it shows that **no matter the value of C**, if A = 0 and B = 1, then Y = 1, so the minterm is $\bar{A}B$.

> Remember that we are writing down the cases that make the equation TRUE.
