Express any truth table using these two standards:
- **Sum of products**
- **Product of sums**

> [!info] Some terms ^minterm-maxterm-literal
> - Literal = variable ($A, B, C, \bar{A}, \bar{C}, \bar{C}$)
> - Minterm = product of all literals ($ABC, A\bar{B}C, ...$)
> - Maxterm = sum of all literals ($A+\bar{B}+\bar{C}, A+B+C$)

## SOP (sum of products)

You represent the truth table of a [combinatorial circuit](4.%20Combinational%20circuits.md) by writing down every minterm that outputs 1.

> [!hint]
> SOP can represent every [boolean function](6.%20Boolean%20Algebra.md).
> It's like saying: it's either this combination or that combination of inputs that returns true.

PS: It produces a short equation if there are few combinations that give 1.

## POS (product of sums)

You write down every maxterm that outputs 0.

> [!hint]
> For it to be true, all the combinations that make it false, must be false.
