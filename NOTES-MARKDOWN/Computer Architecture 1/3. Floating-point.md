It's basically **scientific notation**.
For example.
$$\large 1.73\cdot 10^3$$

It's composed in this way:
$$\large ± \text{ Mantissa } \cdot \text{ Base}^{\text{Exponent}}$$

> [!hint]
> By definition, the **first bit** of the mantissa (the integer part) is always 1, so there is **no need to store it**.


## Conversion

1. Convert decimal to binary, using methods described above.
2. Normalize in scientific notation.

> [!example]
> - The binary number 1101.01 would be normalized to 1.10101 × 2³
> - The binary number 0.00101 would be normalized to 1.01 × 2⁻³

> [!example] From decimal to binary
> Let's convert 58.25 to binary:
> 
> - ${58.25}_{10} = {111010.01}_2$
> - $1.1101001 \cdot 2^5$

## Biased exponent

As you can see in the example above, we don't represent $5$ as **0000 0101**, but as **1000 0100**.

Keep in mind that half of the exponents should be negative [-128, 127].

We bias the exponent by **adding 127 to the real exponent** (**0000 0001 corresponds to -126 instead of 1**), in this way we have **all positive exponents**.

> [!hint] Why all positive exponents?
> This is because we want to **simplify the comparison operations** between numbers.
> 
> > [!example]
> We use [Two's complement](1.%20Integer%20numbers.md#Two's%20complement), and want to compare **2** (**010**) with **-3** (**101**). 
> We need a special circuitry that understands two's complement. (**NOT STONKS** 📉)
> 
> To a simple binary comparison 010 < 101.

> [!hint] Actual range of exponent
> The new range is [-126, 127].
> If we wanted to represent -126, we would do -126 + 127 = 0000 0001.
> 
> **0000 0000** and **1111 1111** are **reserved** for respectively zero (and something else) and infinity.
> 
> So the smallest exponent that we can represent is **-126 = 0001 after bias.**

> [!warning] What happens when we need the real exponent?
> - **Reading**: we just subtract 127.
> - **Addition**: we align the exponents to match the largest one.
> - **Multiplication**: we add the unbiased exponents together and then rebias it.


## Denormals

Until now we showed numbers with implicit leading 1 (**1.fractional part**), but we can represent even smallest numbers if we use **0.fractional part**.

Using IEEE 754 we can use the 23 bits of the mantissa (with **exponent set to 0**) to represent numbers up to $2^{-149}$ ($2^{-126}\cdot 2^{-23}$).

> [!example]
> Let's use a very simplified 8-bit float format example:
> 
> **Normal smallest**:    
> - 1.000 × 2⁻² = 0.25
> 
> **Denormal numbers**:   
> - 0.100 × 2⁻² = 0.125                     
> - 0.010 × 2⁻² = 0.0625                    
> - 0.001 × 2⁻² = 0.03125

## Special cases

And what if we can't represent the number because it's too small? It is rounded to 0 and called **underflow**.

What if it's too big? **Overflow**.

## Half-precision, Single-precision, Double-precision

Until now **we talked about 32 bits** floating-point numbers, so single-precision.
But we can have **half the bits** or **double the bits**, and that is called respectively half-precision and double-precision.

# IEEE 754 Operations


## Addition

We can add two numbers **only when their exponents are the same**.
In the case they aren't, you need to shift the mantissa until they coincide.

> By normalizing we mean shifting the point to left.
> We round if the result doesn't fit in 32 bits.


## Multiplication

Multiply as if they were unsigned numbers.
Number of digits after the point = digits after the decimal point in n1 + digits after decimal point in n2.
Exponents must be summed and bias must be subtracted.

> 2. Multiply the mantissas
> 
> 3. Normalize (if needed) (remember to adjust the exponent)
> 
> 4. Adjust the sign
> 
> 5. Assemble the result
> 

> [!hint] Why subtract the bias?
> Because when we add the two exponents, we have double the bias, so one must be subtracted for the exponent to be correct.

## Overflow and Underflow in operations

When the operation return more bits than the bits we started with, but the **number is in the range** of the possible numbers, it's **not an overflow**, we just need to **round**.
