We have two ways of representing signed binary numbers:
- Sign/Magnitude
- Two's complement

## Sign/Magnitude

The most significant bit is reserved for the sign, the rest is the magnitude/actual number.

### Range

$$\large [-(2^{N-1}-1), 2^{N-1}-1]$$
> [!hint] Range example
> For 8 bits we can represent 256 numbers in total:
> - **1111 1111** = -128 = $-(2^{8 - 1} - 1)$
> - **0111 1111** = 127 = $2^{N-1}-1$


## Two's complement

Addition actually works here and we have a single representation for zero.

The MSB still indicates the sign. For 8 bits, the largets positive number is 0111, the largest negative is 1000.

### Range

$$\large[-2^{N-1}, 2^{N-1}-1]$$

### Flipping the sign

1. Invert the bits
2. Add the 1

### Overflow

**If you add numbers with opposite sign, overflow CANNOT OCCUR.**
Overflow only occurs when the two signs are the same and the result has the opposite sign.

Overflow DOES NOT occur if you have a carry out of the most significant column, **the bit is discarded**.
