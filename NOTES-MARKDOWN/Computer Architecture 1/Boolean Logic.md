## SOP and POS

Express any truth table using these two standards:
- Sum of products
- Product of sums

> [!info] Some terms
> - Literal = variable ($A, B, C, \bar{A}, \bar{C}, \bar{C}$)
> - Minterm = product of all literals ($ABC, A\bar{B}C, ...$)


### SOP

You represent the truth table by writing down every minterm that outputs 1.

> [!hint]
> SOP can represent every boolean function.
