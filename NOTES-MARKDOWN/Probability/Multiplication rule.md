Assume we have $n$ sets($\Omega_1, \Omega_2, \dots, \Omega_n$).
And the lengths of the sets $n_1, n_2, \dots, n_n$
We want to pick a number from each set, how many possible ways we have to do so? How many combinations are possible?

## Dices example

**We throw the first one**: We have 6 outcomes and 6 combinations possible.
**We throw the second dice**: For each choice of the first dice, we have 6 new possible combinations.

The number of combinations is given by:

$$\large |\Omega_1 × \Omega_2|=n_1\cdot n_2$$
which in this case is:

$$\large |\Omega_{d1} × \Omega_{d2}|=6\cdot 6$$

## Generalized formula

$$\large |Ω_1 × Ω_2 × \dots × Ω_N | = n_1n_2 · · · n_N .$$
