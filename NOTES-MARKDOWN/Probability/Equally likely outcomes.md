When all the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of an event depends on the number of outcomes in the event.

$$\large \mathbb{P}(A)=\frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$$

> [!hint]
> $$\large \mathbb{P}(A\cup B)=\mathbb{P}(A)+\mathbb{P}(B)- \mathbb{P}(Aâˆ©B)$$
> 
> The probability of their intersection would be counted twice if we didn't remove it once.
