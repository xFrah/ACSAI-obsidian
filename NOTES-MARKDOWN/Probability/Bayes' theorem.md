Let's look at this example.

What is the probability that if we picked the red ball, the other event was C?

$$\large \mathbb{P}(C|\text{red})=\frac{\mathbb{P}(\text{red}\cap C)}{\mathbb{P}(\text{red})}=\frac{\mathbb{P}(\text{red}|C)\mathbb{P}(C)}{\mathbb{P}(\text{red})}$$

Another way to think about the theorem is: we try to get the probability of getting $C$. Then when we pick a red ball. Now the probability of having picked $C$ before $\text{red}$ is greatly decreased. We updated our belief.
