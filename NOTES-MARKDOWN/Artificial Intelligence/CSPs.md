## Arc Consistency

Arc Consistency is a pre-processing strategy that prunes possibilities by enforcing constraints before proceeding with the search.

It reduces the domains of variables before the search starts by removing values that cannot be part of any solution.
This helps in pruning the search space, making the subsequent backtracking search more efficient.
