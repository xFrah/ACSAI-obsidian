## Passive Reinforcement Learning

### Model-based

In model-based learning, the agent first learns the model of the environment (the [MDP](Markov%20Decision%20Processes.md)) from the experiences. 
This includes learning the transition probabilities and reward functions.

### Model-free

In model-free learning, the agent directly learns the value function (V) or the action-value function (Q) from the experiences, without explicitly learning the transition probabilities and reward functions.
