## Speedup
How much faster the parallel version is compared to the serial one.

## Efficiency
Ratio between the speedup and the number of processors. So basically if it is 1, it means that the speedup is linear because for each processor added, the speedup increases by the same amount.

## Scalability
A system is scalable if it can handle the addition of more processors without losing efficiency.

### Strongly scalable
A system is strongly scalable if when the problem size stays the same and the number of processors increases, the time to solution decreases.

### Weakly scalable
A system is weakly scalable if when the problem size increases proportionally to the number of processors, the time to solution stays the same.
