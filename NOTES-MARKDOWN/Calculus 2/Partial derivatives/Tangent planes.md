A plane is tangent to a surface at a specific point if it "just touches" the surface at that point.
In such planes lie infinite vectors, emanating from the point of contact and going in all possible directions.

We can describe this plane using the dot product between the vector normal to the surface and a generic vector in the plane. **In order for the generic vector to be in the plane, this dot product must be 0**:

$$\Large \vec{n}\cdot \vec{P}=0$$

or, if you write the formula using the vector components:

$$\Large a(x-x_0)+b(y-y_0)+c(z-z_0)=0$$

where $(x-x_0)$, $(y-y_0)$ and $(z-z_0)$ are the components of the generic vector in the plane.
