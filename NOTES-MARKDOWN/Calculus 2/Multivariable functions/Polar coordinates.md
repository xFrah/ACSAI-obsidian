It's an alernative to the cartesian system.
Instead of points being described as $(x, y)$, here we have $(\text{length}, \theta)$.

## Conversion to polar coordinates

$$\Large x=ρ\cos(\theta),\quad y=ρ\sin(\theta)$$

> [!danger] **IMPORTANT**
> Always remember:
> $$\Large \cos^2x+\sin^2y=1$$


### Shifted polar coordinates

When the center point is not $(0,0)$, the conversion becomes:

$$\Large x-x_c=ρ\cos(\theta),\quad y-y_c=ρ\sin(\theta)$$

> [!example]
> With the following limit:
> $$\Large \lim_{(x,y)\rightarrow(1,0)}$$
> The conversion would become:
> $$\Large x-1=ρ\cos(\theta),\quad y=ρ\sin(\theta)$$
