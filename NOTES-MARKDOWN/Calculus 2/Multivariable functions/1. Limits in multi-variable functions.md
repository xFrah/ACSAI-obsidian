Assume we have a function:

$$\Large f(x,y)=\frac{xy}{x^2+y^2}$$

which graphs like this:

You can see both in the formula and in the graph, that $(0,0)$ is undefined.
But does its limit exist?

## Two-path test

Since we can't actually check all the possible paths, we need to find two paths that yield different result and prove that the limit doesn't exist.

Lines are usually the easiest path to check first, we set $y=x$:

$$\Large f(x,y)=\frac{x^2}{x^2+x^2}=\frac{1}{2}$$

Then we check another path, we choose a crossing line for simplicity, $y=-x$:

$$\Large f(x,y)=\frac{-x^2}{x^2+x^2}=-\frac{1}{2}$$

We can see that two different paths yield a different limit, so the limit doesn't exist at $(0, 0)$.

## Solve using [[Polar coordinates]]

Convert the function from the cartesian system to the polar system, and solve in that way.
This is useful because if we can show that the final limit does not depend on the angle, it means that the limit is the same for every possible path.
