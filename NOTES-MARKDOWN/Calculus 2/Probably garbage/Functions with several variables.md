# $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
## Domain and range/codomain

A function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with $n$ variables, has a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ as domain and a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ as codomain.

## Derivative

The derivative remains the same, but we will need to take partial derivatives with respect to each single variable.

> [!example]
> $$\large f(x, y) = \sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}$$
> The domain is $1-x^2-y^2>= 0$
> Which leads to $x^2+y^2<=1$, which is a circle. So the domain in this case are all the values inside the circle.

- A point $(x_0, y_0)$ belongs to the domain ($\Omega$) and is an interior point if (E al contrario) R >0
s.t $(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2< ???$ 

- A point $(x_0, y_0)$ belongs to the domain ($\Omega$) and is an boundary point if (E al contrario) R >0

> [!example]
>$$\large f(x)=\sqrt{x^2-y}$$
>The domain is $x^2-y>=0$, or $y <=x^2$
