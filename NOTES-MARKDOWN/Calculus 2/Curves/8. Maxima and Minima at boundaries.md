When you are asked to get the maxima and minima of a multi-variable function, you should find:
- **Internal stationary points**: Get the points at which $∇f=0$
- **Edge stationary points**: If boundaries for $f$ are provided as functions, parametrize them as curves and study their stationary points.

### How to turn boundary functions $(x, y)$+ values of the function ($z$) to curves

Say that we have already computed the internal boundary points, and we now need to get the ones on the boundaries.
When you have a **boundary line**, you need to **express it as a single-variable function** so you can find its max/min points using regular calculus.

These are the steps, we analyze the third boundary first:
- **Step 1**: Choose one variable as your parameter $t$
$$\Large x=t$$
- **Step 2**: Solve for the other variable in terms of $t$
$$\Large\begin{cases}
x + y = -3 \\
x = t
\end{cases}
\quad\rightarrow\quad y = -3 - t
$$
- **Step 3**: Determine the interval of the boundary. By looking at the other boundary lines and setting x and y. In this case the other boundaries are $x=0$ and $y=0$.
$$\Large\begin{cases}
y = -3 - t \\
t=0
\end{cases}=(0, -3)\quad \text{and} \quad \begin{cases}
y = -3 - t \\
y=0
\end{cases}=(-3,0)$$

- **Step 4**: Finish the substitution. Plug $y=-3-t$ into the original function, to get the actual boundary line. And since it's a function with a single variable, we can derive it and analyze its stationary points.
