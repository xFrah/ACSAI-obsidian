We want to measure the length of a curve in a closed interval.
Since we can compute the **tangent vector at any point**, we can **reduce its magnitude infinitesimally** and **add** them up.

$$\Large \int^{b}_{a}||\gamma'(t)||\;dt$$
where:
- $\gamma'(t)$ is the tangent vector at parameter $t$ (could be at any $x$ and $y$, points are not necessarily equidistant).
- $||\gamma'(t)||$ is the magnitude of the tangent vector.

> [!hint] Recall how the integral works
> $$\Large \sum_{t_i=a}^b||\gamma'(t_i)|| \cdot \underbracket{\Delta t}_{â‰ˆ0}$$
> Little note: usually the sum takes discrete integers, here i'm giving it an interval for clarity.
