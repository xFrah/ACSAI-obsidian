Assume we have a 2D curve/path $C$ (white line, don't mind the orange surface for now):

Now imagine that for each point of our line, we have a measure $f(x,y)$, which can be anything (velocity for example). The point is that we want to add up each value of $f$ along the path $C$.
(The orange surface are the values of f in every point of the space)

We can use an integral to compute the sum of the $f$ values along our path $C$:

$$\Large \int^{t_b}_{t_a}f(x(t),y(t))\;dt$$

We have one problem still. The values given by the curve are not actually eveny spaced out.
When the integral iterates over the interval $[t_a, t_b]$, the curve can output $(x,y)$ points that are not equidistant to each other (component-wise):

To solve this issue, we compensate for it by multiplying for the magnitude of the tangent vector of the curve.

$$\Large \int^{t_b}_{t_a}f(x(t),y(t))\cdot||\gamma'(t)||\;dt$$

This ensures that we account for the spacing, or the pace of the curve.
