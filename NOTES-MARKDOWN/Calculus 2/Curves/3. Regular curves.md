Say that $r'(t)$ is the vector tangent to our curve at point $t$.

$$\Large r'(t)=(x'(t),y'(t),z'(t))$$
A curve is said regular in an interval $[a,b]$ if this vector function is continuous component-wise (the derivatives of the components must be continuous).

> [!example]
> In this example, in order to verify the regularity of a curve, we check if the tangent vector **vanishes**, that is, it equals $0$.
