### Finding domains

The **approach to finding domains is the same**Â for both single-variable and multivariable functions in calculus.

Only difference is the complexity of the domain restrictions.

### Continuity

First, you need to be certain that the function exists at the point you are analyzing.
Second, you need to be certain that all limits pointing to that point, are the same, and coincide with the value of the function.

Set up the limit and use polar coordinates to be certain that you analyze all possible paths.
