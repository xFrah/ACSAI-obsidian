For every possible value we get the corresponding distribution.
The sum of the probability should give 1.

```ad-example

| Toss 2 coins | Probability |
| --- | --- |
| 0 heads | 0.25 |
| 1 head | 0.5 |
| 2 heads | 0.25 |

We can compute [variance](../Statistics/Variance.md) and [standard deviation](../Statistics/Standard%20Deviation.md) of a probability distribution, which should give us an idea of how it really is.

## Distributions for discrete random variables:

#### Mean of a probability distribution

Can be computed by:
$$\Large\mu=\sum xÂ·p(x)$$
It is basically a weighted average, because values of x that are more likely receive greater weight p(x).

It is also called the expected value of X.


## Distributions for continuous random variables

A continuous random variable has infinite possible values in an interval(ex. age, height, weight, income).

It's probability distribution is specified by a density curve and the probability of an interval is given by the area under the curve over the interval(we take the integral).

#### Probabilities for bell-shaped distributions(symmetrical)

- The mean, median and mode are equal.
- Location is determined by the mean $\large \mu$.
- Spread is determined by the standard deviation $\large \sigma$.
- The random variable has an infinite theoretical range, from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$.
- The distribution is completely specified by the two parameters mean and variance.

## z-score and the Standard Normal Distribution

The z-score for a value x of a random variable is the number of standard deviations that x falls from the mean: $\Large\frac{(x - \mu)}{\sigma}$.

- z-score assumes positive values when the value is above the mean and negative when its below.
- A standard normal distribution has mean $\large \mu$ and standard deviation $\large \sigma$  = 1.
- When a random variable has normal distribution and its values are converted to z-scores by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation, the z-scores.
