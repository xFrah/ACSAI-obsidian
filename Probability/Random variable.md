A random variable is a numerical measurement of the outcome of a random experiment.

Example:
Flip a coin three times
X = number of heads in the 3 flips: defines the random variable.
x = 2 represents a possible value of the random variable.

## Discrete and continuous random variables:

A discrete random variable has separate values as possible outcomes(1, 2, 3) and the set is finite:

If the variable can take any value in a real interval it is said to be continuous.
