It's a probability distribution that is symmetric around the mean.
It shows that data near the mean occur more frequently than data far from the mean.

It is also called the Gaussian distribution or bell curve.

Properties:
- The mean is always zero and the standard deviation is 1.
- It is symmetrical.
- Its mean, median and mode are all equal to one another.
- The width of the mean is described by the standard distribution:

## [z-score](../Statistics/Z-score.md) and the Standard Normal Distribution

The z-score for a value x of a random variable is the number of standard deviations that x falls from the mean: $\Large\frac{(x - \mu)}{\sigma}$.

- z-score assumes positive values when the value is above the mean and negative when its below.
- When a random variable has normal distribution and its values are converted to z-scores by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation, the z-scores.
