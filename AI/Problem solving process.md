1. Goal formulation: Limit objectives
2. Problem Formulation: Abstract model of the world
3. Search: Simulate actions sequences till a solution is found or it is found that no solution exists
4. Execution

Assumption:
- [Environment](Environment.md) is fully observable, deterministic and known.
- The [agent](Agent.md) can ignore percepts during execution (open loop?)
- In an unknown envirnment, execute random action!

Wtf complete the lesson!!!!!!! The search problem dude.
