A symmetric matrixi is a [matrix](Matrix.md) that has equal values on both sides of its diagonal.

It is describable by:
$$\Large A_{ji}=A_{ij}$$

title: Why are they useful?
The eigenvectors are perpendicular to each other.

That means that if we pack the eigenvectors(normalized) into a matrix, we obtain an orthogonal matrix that describes a rotation of the basis vectors to the eigenvectors.

But the cool thing is:

If we transpose this orthogonal matrix, we get its inverse, so the counter to the original rotation.

```ad-hint
Non-square matrices cannot be symmetrical.

```ad-info
If the matrix is symmetrical, the eigenvectors are perpendicular.

Why?
