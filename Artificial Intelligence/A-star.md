we combine the overall cost 
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)

g(n) is the cost to reach n
h(n) = estimated movement cost to move from n to the final destination. This is often referred to as the heuristic, which is nothing but a kind of smart guess. We really don’t know the actual distance until we find the path. There can be many ways to calculate this h.

so that f(n) is the expected cost of the most convenient walk from the initial state to the goal state that covers node n.


What A* Search Algorithm does is that at each step it picks the node according to f.
At each step it picks the node/cell having the lowest f, and process that node/cell.


## Approximation Heuristics

We actually could calculate the exact value of h, but that would be time consuming.
For this reason we turn to approximations, an example is the manhattan distance:

```
 h = abs (current_cell.x – goal.x) + abs (current_cell.y – goal.y)
```

## Admissibility and consistency

Admissibility: h(n) is <= to the minimum path cost from n to the goal

Consistency:
For every node n and its successor n' of n generated by action a,
$$\large h(n) \eqslantless c(n,a,n') + h(n')$$

Every consistent heuristic is admissible but not viceversa.

With a consistent heuristic, the first time we reach a state, it us on the optimal path.

If there is a cost-optimal path on which h(n) is admissible for all nodes on the path, that path will be found no matter what.
If the optimal solution has cost C*, the second best has cost C2, abd h(n) overestimates by never more than C2-C*, then jyuhghhjhb
