### 1) Modus Ponens

$$\large\frac{{P \to Q \quad P}}{{Q}}$$

If we have $P$, and $P$ implies $Q$, then we can deduce $Q$.

> [!hint]
> We know $P$ is True.
> So in this case $Q$ can only be True.


### 2) Modus Tollens

$$\large\frac{{P \to Q \quad \lnot Q}}{{\lnot P}}$$

We know that $Q$ is False, hence $P$ can only be False.

> [!hint]
> Because if $P$ was True, it would have turned $Q$ True too.


### 3) Disjunctive Syllogism

$$\large\frac{{P \lor R \quad \lnot R}}{{P}}$$


> [!hint]
> Either $P$ is True or $R$ is true.
> We know that $R$ is False so $P$ must be True.


### 4) Conjunction Introduction

$$\large\frac{{Q \quad P}}{{P \land Q}}$$

> [!hint]
> We know that $P$ is True and $Q$ is True, so an $\land$ between the two must also be True.


### 5) Conjunction Elimination

$$\large\frac{{P \land Q}}{{P}} \quad \frac{{P \land Q}}{{Q}}$$

> [!hint]
> If the $\land$ is True, both components must be True.


### 6) Disjunction Introduction

$$\large\frac{{P}}{{P \lor Q}}$$

> [!hint]
> $P$ is True, so $P$ or $Q$ must be True.


### 7) Double Negation

$$\large \lnot \lnot D= D$$


### 8) Contraposition

$$\large\frac{{P \to Q}}{{\lnot Q \to \lnot P}}$$

> [!hint]
> We know that if $P$ is True, $Q$ is also True.
> So can deduce that if $Q$ is False, $P$ must be False, or it would have turned $Q$ to True.
