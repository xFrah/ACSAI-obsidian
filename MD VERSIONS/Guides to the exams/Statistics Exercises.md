## Exercise 1

![](../z_images/Pasted%20image%2020230429132751.png)


1. <u>Students. </u>
	The subjects are the "keys" of the table. If i'm not retarded they should always be unique.
	
2. <u>Gender, Grade, City, Faculty, Family Income.</u>
	The variables are just the fields of the table.
	
3. [[Variable types]]:
	1. Gender: <u>categorical</u> (Binary, with two categories M, F)
	2. Grade: <u>quantitative discrete</u>
	3. City: <u>categorical</u> (Nominal, with categories Milan, Rome, Naples, Florence)
	4. Faculty: <u>categorical</u> (Nominal, with categories Economics, Statistics, Political Sciences)
	5. Family Income: <u>quantitative continuous</u>


```ad-summary
title: Brief recap on variable types
#### Categorical (or Qualitative) variable

Each observation belongs to a category:
- Binary: There are only 2 categories
	
- Ordinal: The categories have a hierarchy or order.
	
- Nominal: No hierarchy is present.

<br>

#### Quantitative variable

Observations take numerical values that represent different magnitudes of the variable:
- Discrete: The possible values come from a specific set of numbers
	
- Continuous: The values are from an interval.

```



## Exercise 2

1. A [[Association|proportion]] is just $\large \frac{Frequency}{Total\, Observations}$:

2. Pretty simple innit:

## Exercise 3

![](../z_images/Pasted%20image%2020230429134538.png)


1. The subjects here is the number of people in the family, and the frequency is how many families have this number of people in it:

## Exercise 4

![](../z_images/Pasted%20image%2020230429135058.png)


1. This is getting boring:
	![](../z_images/Pasted%20image%2020230429135826.png)
	
2. An [histogram](../AI-LAB/Histogram.md) is a chart used to display numerical data.:
	![](../z_images/Pasted%20image%2020230429140012.png) 
	
```ad-note
title: Histogram vs Bar chart

<br>

The two main differences between a bar chart and a histogram are:
- The bar chart displays categorical discrete data
- The bars of the bar chart are not adjacent to each other, there is a slight padding.
```
	
3. <u>The distribution is unimodal and skewed to the right.</u>
	![](../z_images/Pasted%20image%2020230429140815.png)


```ad-question
When we convert from continuous to intervals, what is the type of the new variable?
```



## Exercise 5

![](../z_images/Pasted%20image%2020230505160646.png)


1.  Each row is a data point, we treat IQ as the X variable and Salary as the Y variable, as we want to look at the correlation between Salary and IQ.

## Exercise 6

![](../z_images/Pasted%20image%2020230505162005.png)

1. Mean, median and mode:
	1. [Mean](../Statistics/Mean.md): $\Large \frac{10+14+14+8+5+6+1+3+7+10+14+9}{12}\normalsize=8.41$
	2. [Median](../Statistics/Median.md): 
			First we sort the data: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 14, 14, 14. 
			The number of values is even, so we have 2 middle values, $8$ and $9$. 
			We take the mean of these two numbers: $\Large \frac{8+9}{2}\normalsize=8.5$.
	1. [Mode](../Statistics/Mode.md): $14$.
	
2. Median > Mean, therefore the distribution is slightly skewed to the left:
	![](../z_images/Pasted%20image%2020230429140815.png)
	
3. This question is so poorly written omfg, the new values are $1, 6, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 20, 28, 28, 28$:
	1. Mean: $\Large \frac{2*(20+28+28+16+10+12+1+6+14+20+28+18)}{12}\normalsize=16.8$
	2. Median: The new middle values are $16$ and $9$, so the new median is $\large \frac{16+18}{2}\normalsize=17$.
	3. Mode: $28$.


## Exercise 7

![](../z_images/Pasted%20image%2020230505164953.png)


1. Mean, and median:
	1. Mean: $\Large \frac{200+ 70+ 88+ 130+ 175+ 89+ 95+ 120+ 400+ 55}{10} \normalsize=142.2$
	2. Median: $\Large\frac{95+120}{2}\normalsize=107.5$
	
2. Skewed to the right, because Median < Mean.
	
3. New $\large\bar{x} = \Large \frac{1.1*(200+ 70+ 88+ 130+ 175+ 89+ 95+ 120+ 400+ 55)}{10}\normalsize= 1.1 * 142.2 = 156.4$
	
4. New $\large\bar{x} = \Large\frac{(10*10)+(200+ 70+ 88+ 130+ 175+ 89+ 95+ 120+ 400+ 55)}{10}\normalsize = 152.2$ 
	
5. New $\large\bar{x} = \Large \frac{(10*10)+1.1*(200+ 70+ 88+ 130+ 175+ 89+ 95+ 120+ 400+ 55)}{10}\normalsize=166.4$
	
6. Change in mean and median:
	1. New $\large\bar{x} = \Large \frac{200+ 70+ 88+ 130+ 175+ 89+ 95+ 120+ 4000+ 55}{10}\normalsize=502,2$
	2. Absolutely nothing lol. Because the order doesn't change and 400 wasn't in the middle anyways.
