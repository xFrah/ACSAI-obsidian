## Excercise 1

![](../z_images/Pasted%20image%2020230429132751.png)

1. <u>Students. </u>
	The subjects are the "keys" of the table. If i'm not retarded they should always be unique.
	
2. <u>Gender, Grade, City, Faculty, Family Income.</u>
	The variables are just the fields of the table.
	
3. [[Variable types]]:
	1. Gender: <u>categorical</u> (Binary, with two categories M, F)
	2. Grade: <u>quantitative discrete</u>
	3. City: <u>categorical</u> (Nominal, with categories Milan, Rome, Naples, Florence)
	4. Faculty: <u>categorical</u> (Nominal, with categories Economics, Statistics, Political Sciences)
	5. Family Income: <u>quantitative continuous</u>


```ad-summary
title: Brief recap on variable types
#### Categorical (or Qualitative) variable

Each observation belongs to a category:
- Binary: There are only 2 categories
	
- Ordinal: The categories have a hierarchy or order.
	
- Nominal: No hierarchy is present.

<br>

#### Quantitative variable

Observations take numerical values that represent different magnitudes of the variable:
- Discrete: The possible values come from a specific set of numbers
	
- Continuous: The values are from an interval.

1. A [[Association|proportion]] is just $\large \frac{Frequency}{Total\, Observations}$:

2. Pretty simple innit:

## Excercise 3

1. The subjects here is the number of people in the family, and the frequency is how many families have this number of people in it:

1. This is getting boring:

2. An [histogram](../AI-LAB/Histogram.md) is a chart used to display numerical data.:

```ad-note
title: Histogram vs Bar chart

<br>

The two main differences between a bar chart and a histogram are:
- The bar chart displays categorical discrete data
- The bars of the bar chart are not adjacent to each other, there is a slight padding.
```
	
3. <u>The distribution is unimodal and skewed to the right.</u>

```ad-question
When we convert from continuous to intervals, what is the type of the new variable?
```
