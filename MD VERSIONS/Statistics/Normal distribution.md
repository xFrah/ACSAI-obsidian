It's a [probability distribution](Probability%20distribution.md) that is symmetric around the mean.
It shows that data near the mean occur more frequently than data far from the mean.

It is also called the [Gaussian distribution](../Machine%20Learning/Gaussian%20distribution.md) or bell curve.

Properties:
- The mean is always zero and the [standard deviation](../Statistics/Standard%20Deviation.md) is 1.
- It is symmetrical.
- Its mean, [median](../Statistics/Median.md) and [mode](../Statistics/Mode.md) are all equal to one another.
- The width of the mean is described by the standard distribution:

## [z-score](../Statistics/Z-score.md) and the Standard Normal Distribution

The z-score for a value x of a [random variable](Random%20variable.md) is the number of standard deviations that x falls from the mean: $\Large\frac{(x - \mu)}{\sigma}$.

- z-score assumes positive values when the value is above the mean and negative when its below.
- When a random variable has normal distribution and its values are converted to z-scores by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation, the z-scores.
