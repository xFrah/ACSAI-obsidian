The long-run average value of random variables.

Each one of those bars represent the probability for $P(X=x)$ to happen.

| x   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P(X=x) | 0.2 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.2 |


In order to get the expected value, we must multiply each outcome with their respective probability. The result will be a weighted average, so the most probable outcome.

In this case: $E(x) = (1*0.2) + (2*0.3) + (3*0.3) + (4*0.2) = 2.5$

The actual formula would be:
$$\large E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i P(X=x_i) = \mu_X$$
