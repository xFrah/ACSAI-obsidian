The significance level is a threshold that determines whether a study result can be considered statistically significant after performing the statistical tests.

A $\alpha$ of 0.05 indicates a 5% risk of concluding that a difference exists between the population [mean](Mean.md) and the sample mean, when there is no actual difference(so the probability of getting a bad sample).

We expect to obtain a sample mean that falls in the critical region 5% of the time.
