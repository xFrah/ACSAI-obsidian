## Good and poor ways to sample

- **Population** is the entire group we are interested in, which we wish to describe or draw conclusions about.
- **Census** is a survey that attempts to count the number of subjects in the poplation and to measure certain charateristics about them.
- **Sample** is a subset of subjects from a population.


## Sampling frame

The sampling frame is the list of subjects in the population from which the sample is taken, ideally it lists the entire population of interest.


## Simple Random Sampling(just Random Sampling)

Every member o the population has the same probability of being selected for the sample.


## Methods of collecting data

- Personal interview
- Telephone interview
- Self-administered interview


## Sources of potential bias in sample surveys

A variety of problems can cause responses from a sample to favor some part of the population over others, but then the results are not representative of the population.

- Sampling bias occurs when using nonrandom samples or having undercoverage
- Nonresponse bias occurs when some sampled subjets refuse to answer some questions.
- Response bias occurs whne the subjects gives an incorrect response, because of lying or wrong wording of the question.


```ad-warning
A large sample does not guarantee absence of bias.

## Poor ways to sample

Convenience sample: when you stop people on the street. But then you are only sampling from people that are more likely to be on the street in that situation.

Volunteer sample: some parts of the population may have more interest in participating in a specific subjects than others.


## Other sampling designs

- Cluster random sample: We divide the population into clusters and then take simple random samples of each of them.


## Observation and experimental data

Researchers can either:
- Experiment study: conduct an experiment using certain experimental conition then observing outcomes.
- Observational study: only observe
