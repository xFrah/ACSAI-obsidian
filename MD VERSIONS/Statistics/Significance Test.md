We are in the third part of statistical inference.

It is a method to check whether or not the data support certain statements or predictions.


```ad-example
We are making inference about the mean of the distribution of bank deposits of Italian families. Last year, we had $\mu = 3$ (tens of thousands of euro).

We want to know if such mean this year is the same or more by knowing that Ïƒ = 1. To this end, we draw a random sample: 5,3,4,3,5,4,4,5,3. The estimated mean is $\bar{x} = 4$.
