It's the average error of the [estimation](../Statistics/Estimation.md) from the samples.

For the sample mean it is:
$$\large e=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

For the sample proportion it is:
$$\large e=\sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}}$$

> Standard error and standard deviation are both measures of variability, but standard deviation is a descriptive statistic that can be calculated from sample data, while standard error is an inferential statistic that can only be estimated.

> When the mean of the estimator sampling distribution is equal to the value of the parameter, then the standard error coincides with the standard deviation.

> This is so because the deviations from the mean coincide with the errors of estimation.
