## Error of estimation

The difference between the statistic(estimate) and the true value of the parameter.

## Standard error

The standard absolute error of estimation of the [[Estimation|estimator]](square root of squared errors mean). 


```ad-note
When the mean of the estimator sampling distribution is equal to the value of the parameter, then the standard error coincides with the standard deviation.

<br>

This is so because the deviations from the mean coincide with the errors of estimation.
