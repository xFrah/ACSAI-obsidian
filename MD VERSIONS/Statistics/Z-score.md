It epresents the number of [[Standard Deviation|standard deviations]] an observation is from the [mean](Mean.md).

$$\huge z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$$

Where: 
- x - is the raw score 
- μ-  is the population mean 
- σ - is the population standard deviation.

- The z-scores have mean 0 and standard deviation 1. 
- Positive z-score indicates the observation is above the mean. 
- Negative z-score indicates the observation is below the mean.
- The z-score also identifies position and potential outliers. 
- An observation from a bell-shaped (or nearly symmetric) distribution is a potential outlier if its z-score is beyond ±3, i.e. if its z-score < −3 or > +3 (3 standard deviation criterion).
