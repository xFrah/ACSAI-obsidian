The gradient of a multivariate function is a vector that contains all its partial derivatives.

$$\large\nabla f=\begin{bmatrix}
\LARGE\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \\
\LARGE\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \\
\LARGE\vdots
\end{bmatrix}$$
If you input a point $(x_0, y_0, ...)$ in the input space of $f$, the vector $\nabla f(x_0, y_0, ...)$ tells you which direction you should travel to increase the value of $f$ most rapidly.
