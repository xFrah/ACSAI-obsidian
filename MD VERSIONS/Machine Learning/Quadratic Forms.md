Given A, a square [matrix](../Linear%20Algebra/Matrix.md) of DxD and x, a vector of D dimensions, a quadratic form is:
$$\large x^TAx$$
It is a vector to scalar function.
It is used for characterizing Definiteness of matrices.

Because for any x != 0, the definiteness of the quadratic form can give you information about the eigenvalues.
