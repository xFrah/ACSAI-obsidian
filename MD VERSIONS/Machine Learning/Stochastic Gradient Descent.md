it was a cold winter morning when i first saw my father hit my mother, the cold had always bothered him. falling down due to the snow was a tipping point for him. the first punch was enough to cause some blood to come from her mouth.
Then the referee came out, he started pegging my father.
Then my mother took out the pope, who then of course raped my little brother, because he's black and because of stochastic gradient descent. (i think)
