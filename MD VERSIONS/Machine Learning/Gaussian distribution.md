$$\large f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^k \det\Sigma}}^{\huge-\frac{1}{2}(x - \mu)^T \Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu)}$$

Basically we have a quadratic form in the exponent
Where:
- $\large \mu$ is the [mean](../Statistics/Mean.md)
- $\large \Sigma$ is the [covariance matrix](Covariance%20matrix.md).
- $\large k$ is the dimensions?

The determinant is hre because if we integrate this its going to 1. If we stretch sigma we should normalize it.
