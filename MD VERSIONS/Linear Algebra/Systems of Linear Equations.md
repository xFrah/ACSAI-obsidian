A system of linear equations is a collection of linear equations involving the same variables.

$$\large\begin{align*} x + 2y - 3z &= 4 \\ 3x - y + 2z &= -1 \\ 4x + y - z &= 2 \end{align*}$$


## Solutions

The solution to such a system is an assignment of values to the variables such that all the equations are satisfied.

A system of linear equations has either: 
1. No solution (if the equations are inconsistent)
2. Exactly one solution (if the system is consistent and the variables are independent)
3. Infinitely many solutions (if the system is consistent and the variables are dependent)


## How to solve

- Parametric solution
- Substitution 
- Elimination (also known as the method of addition) 
- Matrix method (using matrices and, frequently, Gaussian elimination or its variant, Gauss-Jordan elimination)


### Parametric solution

For example, consider the following dependent system of equations:

$$\large\begin{align*} x + y + z &= 3 \\ 2x + 2y + 2z &= 6 \\ \end{align*}$$

We can choose $z$ as a parameter, say $z=t$. Then the solution set of the system can be written as:

$$\large\begin{align*} x &= 3 - t \\ y &= 3 - t \\ z &= t \\ \end{align*}$$

> For every value of $t$, we get a different solution of the system.
> The choice of parameter is arbitrary and does not change the solution set.
