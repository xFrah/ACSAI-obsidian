Preserve angle and distances.
If we want to rotate, we can add one single scalar.
Just using a single number we can rotate.

$$\huge\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1

## Hyperplanes

In an d-dimensiona vector space, an hyperplane has d-1 dimensions and divides the space in two half spaces.
In the case of a 2D space, it's a line. In the case of 3D space it's a plane.

The formula for an hyperplane is
𝐰𝐱+𝐛=0��+�=0

where 𝐰� is a vector normal to the hyperplane and 𝐛� is an offset

## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Eigenvectors in a transformations are the only vectors that don't change direction, but get just scaled.

The determinant of a matrix is the product of eigenvalues.
