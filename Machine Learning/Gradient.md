Takes a vector and outputs a scalar.

STUDY FUCKING PARTIAL DERIVATIVE

The scalars of the vector are telling us what is the effect of perturbation on x on their. axis. Like a derivative, but this is a partial derivative because we are making constant every other variable and shifting only one.

Think of it as a direction. It is the direction of steepest ascent. The direction to change the input so that the function values goes up oin [x, x+e] 

It outputs the direction you shouuld go to get the highest increase in value.

Given that you want to minimize a loss function, you need the direction of steepets descent, -gradient.
