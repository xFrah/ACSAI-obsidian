X is a high dimentional point in a vector space.

Vectors are written column wise. We can make it row wise by transpising it.

A vector isn't just a list of numbers. We need to have an origin and an orientation of the axes.

Imagine a plane with a looot of dimensions, then a vector is just a point inside of it.
Each component i of the vector is a scalar that stands for the coordinate of the dimension i.

## Geometric Interpretation:

### Point in space:
Given a vector, the first interpretation that we should give it is as a point in space

"In two or three dimensions, we can visualize these points by using the components of the vectors to define the location of the points in space compared to a fixed reference called the origin.

### Direction in space:
The bright side of this one is that the vector addition actually makes sense.
It would just be to follow the directions of the first vector, than we follow the directions from the second vector, getting to the point.
