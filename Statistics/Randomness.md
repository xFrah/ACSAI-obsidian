## How probability quantifies randomness

The probability of times that something happens in the short run is very unpredictable, but in the long run it becomes very predictable.

## Law of large numbers:

As the number of trials increase, the proportion of occurrences of any given outcome approaches a particulare number in the long run.


```ad-example
As one tosses a (perfect) die, in the long run 1/6 of the observations will be a 6.

## Definitions

Probability: With random phenomena, the probability of an outcome is the proportion of times (relative frequency) that the outcome occurs in a long run of observations (independent trials).

Independent Trials: Different trials of a phenomenon are independent if the outcome of a trial is not affected by any other trial.


```ad-example
Imagine we have a coin. The probability of a having tail on each flip is still $\large \frac{1}{2}$, indipendently of the previous tosses.
