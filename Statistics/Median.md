The median is the <span style="background:rgba(183, 152, 255, 0.3)">middle value of the observations</span> when they are ordered from the smallest to the largest.

If the number of observations is odd we have one median:
$$\Large\frac{n}{2}$$
If the numbe of observations is even, the medians are:
$$\Large(\frac{n}{2}, \frac{n + 1}{2})$$

Steps to find median:
1. <span style="background:rgba(183, 152, 255, 0.3)">Order the observations</span>;
2. Check the even/odd number thing;
3. Get the median.

```ad-hint
The median is more <span style="background:rgba(183, 152, 255, 0.3)">robust to extreme values</span> than the [mean](../Maths/Mean.md), because the median doesn't take into considerations all the values.

#### Skewed Distributions

- **Median == Mean**: Symmetrical.
- **Median < Mean**: Skewed to the right.
- **Median > Mean**: Skewed to the left.
