The sampling distribution of a statistic is the [probability distribution](../Probability/Probability%20distribution.md) that specifies probability for the possible values the statistic can take.

They describe the variability that occurs from sample to sample, because no sample is equal.


```ad-example
Prior to counting the votes, the proportion in favor of recalling Governor Gray Davis was an unknown parameter.

An exit poll of 3160 voters reported that the sample proportion in favor of a recall was 0.54.

If a different random sample of 3160 voters were selected, a different sample proportion would occur.
